<h2 class="pc4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the twenty years which have passed since Mr.
Green drew his brilliant sketch of the early life
of English towns, and of their influence on the
history of English liberty, the study of the subject in
this country has advanced but little; and it is not, I
think, too much to say that the pages of his History
still present the most vivid and suggestive picture
which we possess of the mediæval boroughs&mdash;a
picture inspired by ardent sympathy and emotion.
In this rapid and original survey the true proportions
of civic history in our national life are boldly drawn;
and the burghers and shopkeepers of the towns, long
neglected and despised, take their place in the distinguished
ranks of those by whom our freedom has
been won by their sturdy battle against oppression,
leading the way in the growth and elevation of
the English people, and carrying across the ages of
tyranny the full tradition of liberty. But the history
of this great civic revolution, which in Mr. Green’s
day cannot be said to have existed at all, has since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
then remained strangely neglected among us. While
in foreign countries the study of the origin and
growth of municipal institutions has been recognized
as of overwhelming importance, and has already employed
the erudition and tried the ingenuity of a
long succession of scholars, English historians have
stood aloof. No English name figures in the contests
of the schools; nor is any English authority called to
witness when a learned theory is advanced to solve
the riddle; and if from time to time foreign scholars
attempt to draw English towns within the range of
their generalizations, the lack of sufficient or trustworthy
materials at their disposal makes the result
vain and unfruitful. No country indeed has been so
backward as our own in municipal history, whether
we take it from the popular or from the scientific
side. The traveller who has asked at the bookshop
of a provincial town for a local history or even
for a local guide is as well able to realize the
distance which parts us from France, Italy, or
Germany, as is the student who inquires for a detailed
account of how civic life or any one of its
characteristic institutions grew up among us. A
certain number of town histories do indeed exist, but
they by no means always deal necessarily or even
mainly with the life of the borough itself. To a considerable
number of local antiquaries the buried relics
of the Roman dominion have proved a permanent
and pre-occupying interest. For the student of
mediæval times the monastery and cathedral tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
high above the squalid market-place and thatched
town-hall which lie dwarfed and obscured under their
vast shadow; and in modern as in older history the
butchers and brewers who represent the secular corporations
of York and Winchester are practically bid
to stand aside before the presence of the spiritual
corporations to whom the fame of S. Mary’s or S.
Swithun’s is committed. Where ecclesiastical monuments
of historic greatness are wanting, a fervent
apologist may still find an excuse for the meanness
and dulness of the municipal story, in the fact that at
some time or other the town has lent its streets to
serve as the stage for a critical scene in the national
drama, and thus&mdash;through the lifting of a royal
standard, or the tragedy of a conspicuous adventurer&mdash;derives
a borrowed title to our interest. That the
story of convent and chapter and solemn pageant
should be told with full detail I do not question. I
only urge that when the tale is finished we still wait
for some notice of the city itself and the humble
details of its common life. There are, it is true,
signs of increasing interest in such matters, and some
admirable studies in our municipal records have
lately been made in England; nevertheless the work
is still at its beginning, and how much need there is
for further study I have had occasion to know in the
course of an attempt to trace the developement of
some forty or fifty provincial boroughs, so as to gain
some idea of the condition of our mediæval towns, and
the general drift of their history. The preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
work which the foreign student finds already finished
and organized for his use, the English worker has
in almost every case to do for himself. Even the
briefest sketch of a town history too often implies
the long labour of seeking out a mass of scattered and
isolated details, which must first be drawn together
into some connected sequence before it is possible to
study the general bearing and significance of the story
in relation to the growth of neighbouring boroughs.
Those who have attempted to find their way through
the uncertainty and confusion of the materials as they
at present exist, will probably be the most lenient
judges of inevitable errors of detail such as must
creep into the performance of so delicate and
difficult a task.</p>

<p>It is evident, indeed, from the nature of the
subject, that any writer who desires to give a survey
of provincial town life as we can now picture it&mdash;from
printed materials scattered in county histories,
archæological journals, reports of commissions, imperfect
abstracts of town documents, parliamentary
records, charters, and stray pamphlets&mdash;must inevitably
remain exposed to much correction in matters
of detail from experts with local knowledge. At
the same time it seems to me that without some
effort to obtain a comprehensive view of the general
subject, the student may leave himself open to the
still graver errors that spring from the want of
some ascertained measure of proportion, and from
the incapacity to distinguish in each town that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
which is normal from that which is strange or characteristic.
The question of origins I have deliberately
set on one side, from the conviction that the beginnings
of a society may be more fruitfully studied
after we know something of its actual life. Avoiding
therefore many dark questions, I have dealt in the
first volume rather with the simpler and less contentious
aspects of the growth of the borough to wealth
and independence. In the second volume, however,
the subjects which arise have long been familiar as
matters of acute discussion; and it has sometimes
happened, that in going over again the sources
from which all our knowledge is derived, I have
found myself gradually compelled to entertain views
contrary to those which are commonly accepted.
Thus, for example, in tracing the growth of self-government
within the borough itself, I seem to
discover in the phrazes of the town records a new
explanation for the position of the “communitas”
side by side with the “cives”&mdash;a problem which, so
far as I know, has never been really stated, and
the difficulties of which are in no way met by the
universally received interpretation. Moreover the
theory of an early triumph and rapid decay of
democratic government appears to me impossible to
maintain, and I have suggested that in the growth of
the common council we may find some evidence of a
popular movement towards more effectual self-government
which seems to have stirred the industrial
classes of the fifteenth century. There are other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
burning questions in which impetuous economists
have outrun the historians, and have not found it
premature to set in order by the help of accepted
theories the obscure chaos of social history in the
Middle Ages. In spite of their zealous efforts, however,
the whole problem (including even the ascertaining
of the facts on which it depends) of the developement
of English commerce and manufactures
and of its effects on social life, still awaits the
student; and it is in the confusion and ignorance which
at present prevail, that I may find my best excuse
for the fact that with regard to many questions&mdash;such,
for instance, as the relation of internal traffic to
free trade and protection, the general organization of
labour, the position of the guild towards the hired
worker, the attitude of the municipality to the industrial
system, and of the capitalist to the town
councillor&mdash;I have ventured to differ from conclusions
which are commonly put forward.</p>

<p>I would add but one word of personal explanation
before I close. The only training or guidance which
I have ever had in historical work was in a very brief
period during which I was able to watch the method
and understand the temper in which Mr. Green’s
work was done. I never had the opportunity of
visiting any English towns with him, or of following
his studies in that direction. The most fruitful
lesson which remains in my memory is that of a day
spent in Ancona between two stages of an invalid
journey, when I was able to see the intense enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
with which, as was his habit, he made his way
first to the Town-hall, and from the fragments of
Greek and mediæval carving built into its walls,
from harbour and pier, from names of streets, and the
cathedral crypt, he extracted century by century
some record of the old municipal life. It was doubtless
some such remembrance as this that unconsciously
led me in the course of reading, to turn to
the story of the English boroughs. At the same
time I have no doubt that I should always have been
restrained from any idea of writing by my consciousness
of the entire lack of adequate preparation for
such a task, if I had not felt bound by an imperative
obligation to make the attempt. When Mr. Green’s
work was over he asked of me a promise that I would
try to study some of those problems in mediæval
history where there seemed to him so much that still
needed to be done, and so much to be yet discovered.
In this book I have made my first beginning
toward the fulfilling of that promise. Such
a work can only be closed with feelings of compunction
and dismay.</p>

<p class="pch">THE ENGLISH TOWNS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing in England to-day with which we
can compare the life of a fully enfranchised borough
of the fifteenth century. Even the revival of our local
institutions and our municipal ambition has scarcely
stirred any memory of the great tradition of the past,
of the large liberties, the high dignities and privileges
which our towns claimed in days when the borough
was in fact a free self-governing community, a state
within the state, boasting of rights derived from
immemorial custom and of later privileges assured
by law.</p>

<p>The town of those earlier days in fact governed
itself after the fashion of a little principality. Within
the bounds which the mayor and citizens defined with
perpetual insistence in their formal perambulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
year after year it carried on its isolated self-dependent
life. The inhabitants defended their own territory,
built and maintained their walls and towers, armed
their own soldiers, trained them for service, and held
reviews of their forces at appointed times. They
elected their own rulers and officials in whatever
way they themselves chose to adopt, and distributed
among officers and councillors just such
powers of legislation and administration as seemed
good in their eyes. They drew up formal constitutions
for the government of the community, and as
time brought new problems and responsibilities, made
and re-made and revised again their ordinances with
restless and fertile ingenuity, till they had made of
their constitution a various medley of fundamental
doctrines and general precepts and particular rules,
somewhat after the fashion of an American state of
modern times. No alien officer of any kind, save only
the judges of the High Court, might cross the limits
of their liberties; the sheriff of the shire, the bailiff of
the hundred, the king’s tax-gatherer or sergeant-at-arms,
were alike shut out. The townsfolk themselves
assessed their taxes, levied them in their own way,
and paid them through their own officers. They
claimed broad rights of justice, whether by ancient
custom or royal grant; criminals were brought before
the mayor’s court, and the town prison with its irons
and its cage, the gallows at the gate or on the town
common, testified to an authority which ended only
with death.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In all concerns of trade they exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the widest powers, and bargained and negotiated and
made laws as nations do on a grander scale to-day.
They could covenant and confederate, buy and sell,
deal and traffic after their own will; they could draw
up formal treaties with other boroughs, and could
admit them to or shut them out from all the privileges
of their commerce; they might pass laws of
protection or try experiments in free trade. Often
their authority stretched out over a wide district,
and surrounding villages gathered to their markets
and obeyed their laws;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it might even happen in the
case of a staple town that their officers controlled the
main foreign trade of whole provinces. In matters
that nearly concerned them they were given the right
to legislate for themselves, and where they were not
allowed to make the law, they at least secured the
exclusive right of administering it; the King and
the Parliament might issue orders as to weights
and measures, or the rules to be observed by foreign
merchants, but they were powerless to enforce their
decrees save through the machinery and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
consent of the town. Arduous duties were handed
over to them by the state&mdash;the supervision of the
waters of a river basin, the keeping of the peace on
the seas. They sent out their trading barges in fleets
under admirals of their own choosing, and leaned but
lightly on state aid for protection or revenge, answering
pillage with pillage, and making their own treaties
with the mariners of other countries as to capture and
ransom and redemption of goods, and the treatment
of common sailors or of “gentlemen” prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The
necessity of their assent and co-operation in greater
commercial matters was so clearly recognized that
when Henry the Seventh in 1495 made a league of
peace and free trade with Burgundy the treaty was
sent to all the chief towns in England, that the mayor
might affix to it the city seal, “for equality and stableness
of the matter;” and the same form was observed
at the marriage of the Lady Mary.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Two hundred
and twenty-six burghers sat in Parliament<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
seventy-four knights of the shire; and each borough
freely decided for itself what the qualifications of its
members should be, and by what manner of election
they should be chosen, at a time when for country
folk all such matters were irrevocably settled by
the king’s law. While the great lords with their
armed bands of liveried retainers absolutely ruled the
elections in the shires, in spite of all statutes of Parliament,
the towns asserted their freedom to elect
without fear or favour, and sent to the House of
Commons the members who probably at that time
most nearly represented the “people,” that is so far
as the people had yet been drawn into a conscious
share in the national life.</p>

<p>Four hundred years later the very remembrance
of this free and vigorous life was utterly blotted
out. When Commissioners were sent in 1835 to
enquire into the position of the English boroughs,
there was not one community where the ancient
traditions still lived. There were Mayors, and
Town Councils, and Burgesses; but the burgesses
were for the most part deprived of any share whatever
in the election of their municipal officers, while
these officers themselves had lost all the nobler
characteristics of their former authority. Too often
the very limits of the old “liberties” of the town
were forgotten; or if the ancient landmarks were
remembered at all it was only because they defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
bounds within which the inhabitants had the right
of voting for a member of Parliament; and in cases
where the old boundaries now subsisted for no
other reason, it was wholly forgotten that they
might ever have had some other origin. In other
boroughs where the right of voting was determined
in another way, the townspeople had simply
lost all remembrance of the ancient limits of their
territory; or else, guided by some dim recollection
of a former greatness with broader jurisdiction and
wide-reaching subject estates, the corporation still
yearly “walked the bounds” of lands over which
they now claimed no authority. As the memory of
municipal life died away there were boroughs where
at last no one suspected that the corporate body
had ever existed for any larger purpose than to
choose members of Parliament. Knowing no other
public honour or privilege and called to no other
public service, the freemen saw in a single degraded
political function the sole object of their corporate
constitution; the representation of the people was
turned by them into “a property and a commerce,”
and this one privilege, fed on corruption and private
greed, survived the decay of all the great duties
of the ancient civic life.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>There were it is true exceptions to this common
apathy, and towns like Lynn might still maintain
some true municipal life, while others like Bristol might
yet show a good fighting temper which counted for
much in the political struggles of the early nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
century. But the ordinary provincial burghers
had lost, or forgotten, or been robbed of the heritage
bequeathed by their predecessors of the fifteenth
century. With the loss of their municipal independence
went the loss of their political authority; and
the four hundred or so of members whom they sent to
Parliament took a very different position there from
that once held by their ancestors. In the Middle Ages
the knights of the shire were the mere nominees of
the wealthy or noble class, returned to Parliament
by the power of the lord’s retainers, while the
burgesses of the towns preserved a braver and
freer tradition.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> At the time of the Reform Bill,
on the other hand, a vast majority of the town
members sat among the Commons as dependents
and servants of the landed aristocracy, whose
mission it was to make the will of their patrons
prevail, and who in their corrupt or timid subjection
simply handed back to the wealthier class the
supreme political power which artisans and shopkeepers
and “mean people” of the mediæval boroughs
had threatened to share with them.</p>

<p>The true story of this singular growth of independence
in the English boroughs and of its no less
singular decay would form one of the most striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
chapters in all our national history. But the materials
for such a story, obscure, fragmentary, and scattered
as they are, still lie hidden away in municipal
archives, state rolls, and judicial records, as though
the matter were one with which Englishmen had
nothing to do. It is true indeed that the many
ingenious expedients which the burghers devised to
meet the peculiar difficulties of a past age would ill
serve as models for our use to-day, nor can their
success or failure be urged on either side of our
modern controversies. They tell us nothing of the
advantages or drawbacks of protection in our own
time, or of the uses of state regulation of labour, or of
the advisability of trade guilds. We cannot revive
their courts or their privileges, any more than we can
set up their gallows or call out modern citizens to dig
a moat that shall be their defence from a hostile
world. We cannot borrow their experience and live
idly on the wisdom of the dead. But there is
no more striking study of the perpetual adjustment
and contrivance by which living communities
adapt themselves to the changing order of the
world than the study of our provincial boroughs in
the Middle Ages; and Englishmen who now stand
in the forefront of the world for their conception of
freedom and their political capacity, and whose contribution
to the art of government has been possibly
the most significant fact of these last centuries, may
well look back from that great place to the burghers
who won for them their birthright, and watch with a
quickened interest the little stage of the mediæval
boroughs where their forefathers once played their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
part, trying a dozen schemes of representation, constructing
plans of government, inventing constitutions,
with a living energy which has not yet spent its
force after traversing a score of generations.</p>

<p>There is no better starting point for the study of
town life in England than the fifteenth century itself,
when, with ages of restless growth lying behind them,
and with their societies as yet untouched by the
influences of the Renascence or the Reformation or
the new commercial system, the boroughs had
reached their prosperous maturity. It would be
vain to attempt any reconstruction of their earlier
history without having first stood, as it were, in the
very midst of that turbulent society, and by watching
the infinite variety of constitutional developement
learned to search out and estimate the manifold
forces which had been at work to bring about so
complex a result; and no study of their later history
is possible without an understanding of the prodigious
vitality of the mediæval municipalities.
There were the workshops in which the political
creed of England was fashioned, where the notion of
a free commonwealth with the three estates of king,
lords, and commons holding by common consent
their several authority, was proved and tested till it
became the mere commonplace, the vulgar property
of every Englishman. There the men who were
ultimately to make the Reformation were schooled in
all the vexed questions between church and state,
and in the practical meaning of interference in civic
matters by an alien power, so that the final crisis of
religious excitement was but the dramatic declamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
on a grand scale of lessons diligently repeated
class by class for many a generation beforehand.
There, too, long before the great national struggles of
later centuries between England and the continental
powers exalted patriotism to its highest ardour, men
were already inspired by the vision of the English
nation holding its post against the world, and by a
passionate allegiance to its great destiny; and in
every market and harbour the love of country was
quickened by the new commerce with its gigantic
ambition to win for England the dominion of the
seas, its federations of merchants held together by
the desperate struggle for supremacy, and its hordes
of pirates who swept the ocean with the wild joy of
their Norse ancestors. There is no break in our
history when the old world merged into the new, for
the spirit of the fifteenth century was the spirit of
the sixteenth century as completely as it is the spirit
of to-day.</p>

<p>The towns as we find them in the fifteenth
century were the outcome of centuries of preparation.
It was by a very slow and gradual process that
England was transformed from a purely agricultural
country, with its scattered villages of dependent
tillers of the soil, into the England we know to-day&mdash;a
land of industrial town communities, where
agricultural interests are almost forgotten in the
summing up of the national wealth. Our modern
towns, indeed, can almost all trace back their history
into the obscurity of a very distant past; but their
record as we find it in Domesday, or under the
Norman kings, is simply that of little country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hamlets, where a few agricultural labourers gathered
in their poor hovels, tilling by turns their lord’s land
and their own small holdings; or of somewhat bigger
villages which lay at the branching of a great road,
at a river ford, or at a convenient meeting-place for
fair or market, and thus grew into some little consequence
as the centres of a small local trade; while
along the coast a few seaports were just beginning to
draw merchants with their wares to a land that had
long been almost forgotten by the traders of the
Continent. It was not till the twelfth century<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that
our boroughs began to have an independent municipal
history&mdash;from the time, that is, when the growth of
the wool trade under Henry the First gave them
a new commercial life; and the organization of local
government under Henry the Second opened for them
the way into a new world of political experiment
and speculation.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> From this time all went well with
the municipalities for three hundred years. In the
course of the thirteenth century the great majority of
towns obtained rights of self-government, until finally
these grants came to an end simply because there
were no unenfranchised towns left.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Not indeed
that the flow of royal charters ceased, for burghers
who had got the first instalments of independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
were constant in pressing for all such further privileges
as could magnify their authority or protect their
dignity; and successive generations of patriotic
citizens gathered into their town chests under the safe
keeping of half a dozen locks piles of precious parchments,
each of which conferred some new boon or
widened the borders of liberty. Determined as it was
by local circumstances the struggle for independence
was carried on after an irregular fashion, first in one
town, then in another; here the burghers pressed
forward riotously, and there loitered indifferently or
stopped discouraged on their way. Some towns were
allowed to elect their mayor before 1200,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> others did
not win the right till three or four centuries later;
Bristol was made a shire in 1375, more than a
hundred years before Gloucester; and in the fifteenth
century there were still boroughs which had to gain
their first charters, or else to exchange narrow and
insufficient rights for full emancipation. But the
forward movement never ceased; every victory
counted for liberty, and every success justified faith
and inspired new zeal. The burghers went on
filling their purses on the one hand, and drawing up
constitutions for their towns on the other, till in the
fifteenth century they were in fact the guardians of
English wealth and the arbiters of English politics.</p>

<p>At first indeed municipal life, even at its best,
was on a very humble scale. The biggest boroughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
could probably in 1300 only make a show of four
or five thousand inhabitants, and of enfranchised
burgesses a yet smaller number;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> while the mud or
wood-framed huts with gabled roofs of thatch and
reeds that lined their narrow lanes sheltered a
people who, accepting a common poverty, traded
in little more than the mere necessaries of life.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It
was not till the middle of the fourteenth century
that the towns as they entered on a larger industrial
activity began to free themselves from the indescribable
squalor and misery of the early Middle Ages; but
from this time forward we begin to detect signs of
stirring prosperity, at first under the guise of a frugal
well-being, and later carrying its luxury with happy
ostentation. In the course of the next hundred years
we see trading ports such as Lynn, Sandwich, Southampton,
or Bristol, and centres of inland traffic such
as Nottingham, Leicester, or Reading, and manufacturing
towns like Norwich, Worcester, York, heaping
up wealth, doubling and trebling their yearly expenditure,
raising the salaries of their officers,
building new quarters, adorning their public offices
and churches, lavishing money on the buying of new
privileges for their citizens, or on the extension of
their trade. And while the bigger boroughs were
thus enjoying their harvest of blessing and fat things,
the small seaports and market towns also gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in their share of the general good fortune by which
all England was enriched.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the town of Colchester, where
from the time of the Conquest a population of about
2,200 had found means to live, but in those two
hundred and fifty years had never added to their
numbers. Of their manner of life we can tell something
from the records of a toll levied on their goods
about 1300. One of the wealthiest tradesmen in
the town was a butcher, whose valuation came to
£7 15<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; while the stock-in-hand of his brethren
in the trade consisted mostly of brawn, lard, and a
few salting tubs, though one had two carcases of oxen
at two shillings each, and another had meat worth
thirty shillings in his shop. If we add to the butchers
thirteen well-to-do tanners, and fourteen mercers
who sold gloves, belts, leather, silk purses, and needle-cases,
besides cloth and flannel, and one even girdles
(which, with their silver ornaments, were costly
articles), we have exhausted the list of the Colchester
plutocrats. In the course of the fourteenth century,
however, the makers of cloth came to settle beside
the tanners and butchers. Card-makers, combers,
clothiers, weavers, fullers, and dyers gathered to the
town, and spread their trade out into the neighbouring
villages. Wool-mongers pushed their business,
till in 1373 the bailiffs made the under-croft beneath
the old Moot Hall into a Wool Hall for the convenience
of dealers, and added a fine porch with a
vault overhanging the entrance to the Moot Hall,
and some shops with solars over them. Before the
century had closed the population had more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
doubled. The poor houses that once lined the streets
were swept away, and wealthy men built shops in
the new style with chambers over them fronting the
street, and let them to shopkeeping tenants.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In the little trading town of Bridport we have the
same story. In 1319 Bridport, with its one hundred
and eighty burgesses, could not at a “view of arms,”
or muster of fighting men, produce a single burgher
who bore bow and arrows, and sent out its motley
regiment equipped with the universal knife or dagger,
or, as it might chance, with staves, hatchets, pole-axes,
forks, or spears, while an aristocrat or two actually
bore a sword. Only sixty-seven burgesses out of the
one hundred and eighty paid taxes, and the general
poverty seems to have been extreme. The richest
man had one cow, two hogs, two brass platters, a few
hides, and a little furniture&mdash;the whole worth £4 8<i>s.</i>;
and one of the most respectable innkeepers of the
place owned two hogs, two beds, two table-cloths, two
hand napkins, a horse, a brass pot, a platter, a few
wooden vessels, and some malt.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In 1323 things
were a trifle better, for eighty persons were then
taxed, the property of some of them being valued
only at six shillings, and this under a system in
which the whole of each man’s possessions was exactly
reckoned up&mdash;his cards, yarn, shoes, the girths he
was making or trying to sell, even his store of
oatmeal. A century later, however, we find a new
Bridport. Traders from Bristol had settled in its
streets, and men of Holland and foreign merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and craftsmen; and the townsfolk had grown prosperous
and began to bind themselves together in
fraternities&mdash;the brotherhood of S. Nicholas, the
brotherhood of S. Mary and S. James, the brotherhood
of the Two Torches, a brotherhood of the Light
of the Holy Cross in S. Andrew’s, and another in
S. Mary’s, and the brotherhood of the Torches in the
Church of the Blessed Mary&mdash;apparently the offspring
of the first half of the fifteenth century. The Toll
Hall was repaired, the houses in the town set in
order, and a new causeway made. The Guild Hall
got its clock; the church was rebuilt and fitted up
with organs, and sittings in it were let out to the
wealthy burghers. When, finally, a “view of arms”
was again held in the town in 1458, there was not a
single name left of those who had appeared in the
list of 1319. But these new traders came bravely
set out with bows and arrows, as well as with daggers,
bills, pole-axes, or spears, or marching proudly with
their mails, jacks, salets, and “white harness with a
basenet.” The Bridport standard had changed, and
one man who came carrying quite an armoury&mdash;a
gun, besides a bow, twelve arrows, a sword, and a
buckler&mdash;was ordered to have twelve more arrows at
the next muster.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Even towns which like Rye had known all the
calamities of war were only waiting for a moment
of peace to win their share of the common prosperity.
Burned by the French in 1377, burned and laid
desolate again in 1448, Rye long remained on the
level of poverty common in the Middle Ages. In
1414 it sheltered a mere handful of struggling
people&mdash;twenty-one poor householders in Nesse  Ward,
twenty-eight in Water Melle  Ward, and a somewhat
larger number in Market Ward equally poor; within
its walls, in fact, there was but one man&mdash;the lord
of the manor&mdash;who was assessed at so great a sum as
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, though there was the beginning of a fashionable
suburb in the Ward without the Gate, where the
Mayor lived with some dozen other well-to-do householders,
two of whom besides the Mayor were assessed
at the aristocratic figure of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> By the end of
the century, however, Rye fishermen were known on
distant seas and Rye traders in the fairs at home and
abroad. London merchants had bought property in the
thriving town, and new quarters had sprung up with
names borrowed from the capital&mdash;Paternoster Ward
and Bucklersbury  Ward. In 1493 five of the
burghers were assessed as owning £400 each, and
the total value of the property possessed by the
inhabitants was £6,303.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Evidence of accumulating wealth indeed gathers
on every side. The labour and enterprise which in
earlier centuries had covered England with castles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and cathedrals and monasteries was now absorbed
in the work of covering it with new towns. A
journey through any part of the country to-day is
enough to show us how ruthlessly the men of the
fifteenth century swept away the parish churches
which their fathers had built in the fourteenth
century, to replace them with the big bare fabrics
where size and ostentation too often did service for
beauty, and in the building of which prosperous
burghers gave more conspicuous proof of wealth and
lavish generosity than of taste and feeling. In
Canterbury and Worcester and Nottingham and
Bristol and a host of other towns we may still admire
the new houses that were being raised for the traders,
with their picturesque outlines and fine carved work.
Waste places in the boroughs were covered with
buildings and formed into new wards. On every
side corporations instinct with municipal pride
built Common Halls, set up stately crosses in the
market-place such as we still see at Winchester or
Marlborough, paved the streets,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> or provided new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
water-supply for the growing population.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> If we
count up the new gates, and quays, and bridges, and
wharves, and harbours, and sluices, and aqueducts,
and markets of which the town records furnish
accounts, we are filled with amazement at an activity
which was really stupendous. Public duty and
private enterprise went hand in hand. Sometimes
the whole commonalty was called out to help at
the church-building, or the digging of a new harbour;
sometimes the charity once given to religious uses
was turned into the channel of civic patriotism, and
good citizens left money to found hospitals and
almshouses and schools, to pave the streets, to pay
the tolls of their town, to fee lawyers to defend its
privileges, or buy a charter to protect its rights from
invasion. Thus it was two traders of Canterbury
who built in 1400 the first private bridge over the
river; and in 1485 a mercer from London, William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Pratt, constructed at his own expense the first main
drain under the Old Street to carry off the rain-water
into the river.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In Birmingham the whole community
formed itself into a “guild and lasting brotherhood” for
the doing of works of charity, and chiefly it would
seem for the repairing of two great stone bridges and
divers foul and dangerous ways on the high road to
Wales&mdash;a work which the Corporation was too poor
to undertake.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this growth in wealth the only, or indeed
the most striking part of the town’s history during
these three centuries from the time of Henry the
Second to the time of Henry the Seventh. Trade
is pretty much the same wherever it exists at all, and
from its narrow dominion much of human energy will
always make a way to escape. When Englishmen
had spent a measure of their force in creating a
nation of shopkeepers, there was still enough of
buoyant and exuberant strength left to elaborate
an art of government which has affected the history
of the world; and the truly characteristic part
of the mediæval story is that which enables us to
measure the political genius with which the forerunners
of our modern democracy shaped schemes
of administration for the societies they had created of
free workers. There was much to be done in the
new ordering of life.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Already in the twelfth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
century a new force had declared itself when in France
the middle and lower classes for the first time found
a voice in literature. From that time onwards poets
of the people and teachers of socialism, writing in the
vulgar tongue for common folk, proposed startling
questions and boldly pressed home their conclusions.
Nothing was safe from their criticism; as they discussed
the original rights of men, the “social contract”
between the people and their lords, the tyranny of
nobles, or the rights of peasants,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> these new thinkers
among the people gave warning of growing energies
too big and passionate to live at ease in the narrow
bondage of mediæval custom and tradition. The
inevitable changes however came slowly, and those who
lived in the midst of the movement were themselves
unconscious of the real transformation that was going
on. Even at the end of the fourteenth century the
writer of Piers Ploughman, when he paints for us
the picture of the feudal world as it then was, has no
dream that its bondage can ever be broken, that there
is any escape out of the prison-house of mediæval
society. For the first time we there see England,
not as it appeared to historians and satirists of the
court or the monastery, but as it looked to one
standing in the very midst of that vast “field full of
folk from end to other”&mdash;to the poet who walked
among the people with his heart full of charity and
pity, who by day mixed with the crowd at the fair,
or watched the bargainings in the market-place, or
travelled along country by-ways and entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
hovels of the poor, and at night sat in the ale-house
among beggars and mendicant friars. But while he
shows us all the trouble and confusion of that tumultuous
crowd, the social order remains to him simple
and unchangeable&mdash;fixed, in his belief, as firmly as
the decrees of God and nature could establish it.
He could only repeat the old time-honoured counsels
of work and obedience as the final remedy for all
social ills: “Counsel not the commons the King to
displease.” But it was more than possible that work
and obedience might still leave, as it had left before,
life empty of all but misery. Then the last solace
lay in resignation.</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">
“Yea, quoth Patience, and hente out of his poke<br />
A piece of the Pater Noster and proffered to us all.<br />
And I listened and looked what livelihood it were;<br />
Then was it ‘Fiat voluntas tua’ that should find us all.<br />
‘Have, Actyf,’ quoth Patience, ‘and eat this when thee hungreth<br />
Or when thou clomsest for cold or clyngest for drought;<br />
And shall never gyves thee grieve nor great lord’s wrath,<br />
Prison nor other pain for&mdash;<i>patientes vincunt</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Such was Langland’s final solution for the disorders
of his time. But the English were not a patient
people, and the problem of the reorganization of
society had become a very serious one towards the
close of the Middle Ages, and was perhaps more
urgent to men’s fears and consciences in the fifteenth
century than it had ever been before, or was
to be again till our own day. It was a pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
question for humble folk, for shopkeepers and
traders and artisans and journeymen who in the
absence of privilege were driven to think of liberty;
and in the crowded lanes, the mean workshops, the
disorderly market-place, the little thatched Common
Hall of the mediæval town, great principles of freedom
found their early home, and fought their way to
perfection and supremacy. It was not enough that
the burghers should create societies of free men&mdash;”<i>gentlemen</i>,”
as Piers Ploughman would have
said,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to whom the great difference that distinguished
between man and man was not wealth or
poverty, labour or ease, but freedom or bondage. This
was the easier part of their task, and was practically
finished early in their history. It was a longer and more
difficult business to discover how the art of government
should be actually practised in these communities,
and to define the principles of their political existence.
But in these matters also the burghers became the
pioneers of our liberties, and their political methods
have been handed down as part of the heritage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the whole people. As by degrees the multitude
of privileges promised and confirmed left the important
towns with no more demands to make, they
turned their energies to the work of framing those
elaborate and highly artificial constitutions which
mark the highest point to which their proud and
self-sufficient independence had attained. Instead of
tamely accepting the pattern or the theory of its
neighbours, every town was making its own peculiar
experiment in the art of governing, with a vivacity
and a restless ingenuity proper to the culminating
moment of their activity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile by a happy coincidence the boroughs
were called to take part in the great movement by
which the House of Commons was created, at a time
when the discipline and experience of local self-government
had prepared them to exercise a very real
influence in the moulding of the English constitution
into its present form. Having for the most part
secured their fundamental liberties just before Simon
de Montfort in 1265 summoned the middle class to
take their share in the work of Parliament, and having
steadily strengthened their position during all the
thirty years of changing counsels and tentative experiments
which followed, they saw the representation
of the boroughs definitely established in 1295&mdash;the
very year after county representation had been at
last perfectly acknowledged.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> If for a time they played
apparently a small part in political battles, if the
separate action of the borough members is scarcely
mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the fact still remains that throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
century during which the House of Commons was being
fashioned<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> members sent from these free self-governing
communities formed almost two-thirds of that House.
Edward the First sent Parliamentary writs to 166
towns, and in the Parliament of 1399, 176 representatives
of boroughs sat by the seventy-four
knights of the shire.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Silent and acquiescent as
they were for a while, there are significant instances
to show the steady growth of their importance,
and the way in which statesmen had
begun to appreciate the new force with which governments
had henceforth to reckon.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> By the close of the
fourteenth century their influence was marked; and it
was doubtless through its vigorous burghers that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
House of Commons in the early part of the fifteenth
century laid hold of powers which it had never
had before, nor was to have again for two hundred
years.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In the list of petitions and statutes throughout
the century in which their influence on legislation
was plainly dominant, we may look for the true
beginning of democratic government in England.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Indeed at a yet earlier time, when the House of
Commons was not seventy years old, its power had
been already measured and men’s imaginations
kindled by its mighty destiny. If supreme over all
the King kept his state at Westminster,</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">“him lord antecedent,</p>
<p class="pp4">Both their head and their King, holding with no party,<br />
But stand as a stake that sticketh in a mire<br />
Between two lands for a true mark”;</p>

<p class="pn1">if his power was absolute, and he could</p>

<p class="pp10 p1">“claim the commons at his will</p>
<p class="pp4">To follow him, to find him, and to fetch at them his counsel,”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">yet even then Conscience warned the sovereign that to
frame a righteous government “without the commons’
help it is full hard, by my head”;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and Reason</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“counselled the King his commons to love,</p>
<p class="pp4">For the commons is the King’s treasure.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The whole part however played by the towns in
national politics, the degree of influence they exercised,
in what ways it differed from that of the aristocratic
class, how it affected matters of administration,
finance, foreign policy, commercial laws, the strength
of the monarchy, and the forms of the constitution&mdash;all
these questions have still to be investigated. What
is perfectly clear is that wise rulers in those days saw
the tremendous change that was taking place in the
balance of forces in the State, as even the most foolish
among them felt that the power of the purse at least
was passing from the country magnates to the town
merchants;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and they gave expression to their convictions
by a change in the whole character of their policy.
To kings and statesmen the friendship of the burghers
even in times of comparative quiet was daily becoming
a matter of greater consequence to be bought at
their own price. It was no longer the nobles whom
they sought to bribe to their interest, but the towns;
and as gifts and pensions to Court favourites declined,
courtesies and gracious remissions of rent were lavished
on the boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> From this time, even when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
towns had fallen to their lowest estate, their heritage
of power was never wholly lost, and through their
later humiliation and corruption we may still discover
the evidence of their political consequence, since the
measure of their influence was in fact the price set
on their obedience.</p>

<p>If such a tale of long centuries of national growth
ending in a satisfied maturity carries its suggestion of
dull monotony, we need only turn to the history of
towns in other times and places to discover that in this
very monotony is hidden a real element of singularity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The most striking contrast lies perhaps close at hand,
in the brilliant and dramatic story of the communes
in France&mdash;the shortest lived of all the feudal independent
lordships in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Of earlier origin
than the English, their history goes back to the
first part of the twelfth century, fifty years before
the movement had effectively begun in England;
and the story of their liberties is, taken all together,
but a brief tale of some two hundred years, from
1130 to 1330. Their progress was rapid and their
decay as swift. Indeed decline had already set in
by 1223, at the very time when Norwich, Nottingham,
and a number of the greater English towns
were just receiving for the first time powers of
choosing their own rulers and administering their own
justice. In 1280 their condition was almost hopeless,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and half a century later the life of the free communities
was over and their liberties utterly
extinguished, saving always the liberty to carry on
trade.</p>

<p>And yet we can only wonder that the attempt
lasted for two hundred years, set as they were amid
difficulties wholly unknown to English burghers, or
with the ghosts or dim reflections of which these at
the worst had only to contend in a kind of phantom
fight. What were the far-off echoes of foreign conquest
or defeat heard on our side of the water, or
the report of an occasional local rising, compared
to the devastating wars that swept the plains
of France, and amid the miseries of which the communes
were struggling into life? The necessities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
war proved fatal to local liberty, and that in more
ways than one. If warring kings and lords created
independent communities for their own purposes,
with the sole idea of forming fortified centres
capable of self-defence, such communes could hardly
prove strongholds of freedom, and the self-government
of the people soon fell in fact before the
requirements of military discipline. Sometimes the
death of freedom was brought about by more violent
methods; and the trembling inhabitants who made
their way back from the woods to their ruined homes
after a town had been sacked and burned by the
enemy, would pray to be disenfranchised that they
might thus be delivered from the burdens and dues of a
commune which they were no longer able to maintain.
Abroad moreover feudalism retained the authority
which had been torn from it here by Norman kings, and
was yet more dangerous to the burghers than war itself.
Against the might of their feudal lord, king or noble
or ecclesiastic, they could make in the long run but a
sorry fight, and perhaps after a century of desperate
struggle for emancipation in which the peasants saw
their brethren slain in thousands, their farms devastated,
their wealth torn from them, their emigrants
driven back starving to plundered homesteads, the
outcome of all their misery was finally to gain a few
trading privileges by consenting to a charter which
once more laid them bound at the feet of their master.
Too often the lord avoided open violence by calling
political craft to his aid, and devised for his burghers
some form of charter which while it admirably suited
his own purposes robbed the communal government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of any true democratic element and made the name of
liberty a mockery. As for the vast number of towns
big and little under ecclesiastical dominion, they contended
in vain against princes of the Church whose
mighty state was measured on the grand scale of the
Continent&mdash;princes with the Pope always in the background,
ready at their complaint to fulminate the decree
of excommunication which left all the burghers’ goods
at the mercy of their lord. Whether the prelate sought
to annihilate rebellious serfs with fire and sword,
whether with more subtle intention he devised some
cunningly delusive form of charter, or contrived to
hinder all the operations of free government, to thwart
its developement, and to check the spread of its influence,
the tragic close was always at hand&mdash;political
slavery and degradation. Amid the innumerable
troubles that compassed the French communes round
about, the administrative difficulties, the financial
cares, the public bankruptcy of town after town,
the evil moments when the king’s fiscal officer and
the starving people made alliance to destroy the
privileges of the burghers, civic freedom failed.
Time and fate were allied against the commune, and
the issue of the battle was decided before the fight
had well begun.</p>

<p>Against the century of growth and the century
of decay which made up the record of the French
communes, we have to set three hundred years of
unbroken prosperity and privilege in which the
English burghers added charter to charter and filled
their “common chests” with a regularity that knew
no check. It is not necessary, however, to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that Englishmen reached that happy state wholly by
virtue of their native superiority; it would perhaps
be truer to thank the good fortune of insignificance
that so long waited on them. England, in fact, was
lagging far away in the rear, where there was little
of the noise and dust of battle. It was not there that
the idea of municipal liberty was first proclaimed;
for in the Dark Ages of riot and disorder and piracy,
Celts, Latins, Teutons, all the members of the
European brotherhood in fact, found in association
their natural succour against danger and aid to
labour; and along the great trade routes that
traversed Europe the more important societies of
men confederated for protection and assistance were
formed before ever Englishmen had begun to organize
themselves into self-governing communities. In that
European drama, everything took great continental
proportions; men disputed for tremendous stakes,
and in the long battle the mighty lords of the old
world were never wholly routed, but still laid their
grip on the modern society that was struggling to
usher in a new order. In the great fight there were
great defeats, such as we have seen in France, and
liberty had to begin its course afresh and lead men
along new roads in search of freedom and content.
But we in our distant island had throughout the
Middle Ages all the advantages of obscurity. According
to any valid method of determining our place in
the European order, whether by yearly income, or
size of merchant fleets, or strength of armies, or
number of inhabitants, we remained for a time after
the loss of Normandy and Anjou unimportant in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
eyes of Europe-of little account among the peoples;
and as far as popular feeling went ourselves heedless
of what went on on the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Tranquil and
secure because no one took the trouble to think
of us while we were regardless of their quarrels,
we were left to learn our lessons as slowly as we
would, to lay sure, if lowly, foundations, to practise
our skill by safe experiments till our art was mastered.
The humble display which we made in our national
capacity was repeated in our municipal story. There
indeed the tiny dominion of the community, the
sparse population, the poor little treasure-box, the
solitary “common barge,” the handful of militia
passing in review with their clubs and forks, present
a sorry figure beside the majestic state of the big
corporations over sea. But this humble condition
was their true security. Set from the first in pleasant
places where by conquering kings the lofty had
been brought low and the humble lifted up, and
where no enemy of invincible strength lay any longer
across their path, the burghers might carry on their
own business without care. Within the narrow
area enclosed by the city wall and ditch, amid a
scanty population scarcely bigger than that of a small
country town to-day, experiments which would
have been impossible on a great scale were tried
with every conceivable variety of circumstance and
expedient; and the boroughs owed to their early insignificance
and isolation a freedom from restraint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and dictation in which real political experience
became possible.</p>

<p>Thus in England, as elsewhere, the character of
the nation and the mould of its political thought were
ultimately shaped by outward circumstance; and
the forms of our freedom have been profoundly
affected by the way which the towns took to liberty,
by the manner in which they modified its expression
according to the peculiar conditions to which each
community was subject, and by the use they made of
their power. But since the very existence of the
towns as important centres of life, as well as the
character of their development, depends on the complete
transformation which English society underwent
in the later Middle Ages, I venture, before beginning
my real story, to give a very brief and rapid sketch
of the Industrial and Commercial Revolution in
which mediæval England was buried and modern
England born.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OF THE FIFTEENTH
CENTURY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the fifteenth century has long
remained but little known. It is very generally
regarded as the “profoundly tragic close of a great
epoch,” and the historian looks back to the golden age
of the thirteenth century as the glorious time of English
and of European history&mdash;the culminating period to
which all the foregoing generations slowly mounted,
and from whose heights the later sons of men as
slowly and surely declined and went backward.
The period of this backsliding is seen as an age
altogether wanting in picturesqueness and moral
elevation, sunk in materialism, sordid and vulgar,
a time of confused and indiscriminate corruption,
where “heart and treasure” were linked in ignoble
union, and the political demoralization of the people
was only matched by their private degradation; and
the fifteenth century has long borne the heavy
burden of its evil reputation, while its records have
been left comparatively undisturbed by inquisitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
search.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> For hackneyed as the period of the Wars of
the Roses may seem to the superficial reader, no
student has yet adequately studied the secret of the
age in which the great revolutions of the next century
were being prepared&mdash;the age which made possible for
England the revival of letters and the reformation,
which founded her commercial greatness, which
revolutionized her industrial system, which cast away
the last bonds of feudalism and laid the foundations of
the modern State.</p>

<p>It is indeed true that no great man has made
this century illustrious. No general or warrior of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the first rank distinguished wars which were born
in iniquity, and kept alive by greed. No gifted
statesman left his mark on the government or administration
of the country. Among the people
themselves interest in national affairs seemed dead;
they made revolutions and set up new kings as
they were bidden to do, and kept stores of badges of
the houses of York and Lancaster alike, to be ready
with either sign of loyalty as the fortunes of war turned
this way or that;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> they forgot the stirring political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
ballads of former generations and sang moral ditties
instead. In place of the mighty theologians of an
earlier time there came commentators and interpreters
of little significance. Nor did a single religious leader
or reformer or scholar arise to stir the popular thought
or conscience: Lollardy with its questionings and criticisms
was still heard of from time to time in the bigger
towns and manufacturing districts, but the people
generally acquiesced in the demands of the authorized
religion and discipline. Literature was well nigh
lost as well as the graver kinds of learning. In the
beginning of the century one or two nobles had collected
libraries and brought tidings of the Renascence
in Italy, and later on half a dozen scholars made their
way to the Italian universities; but there was neither
poet nor scholar to follow the masters of an earlier age.
In the fifteenth century the very language in which
Chaucer wrote was but half intelligible to the mass
of the people, and his tales must have been unknown
out of court circles. Men were content with rhymes
innumerable&mdash;on morals, on manners, on heraldry, on
the art of dining, on the rules of thrift and prosperity;
and in all our history there is no time so
barren in literature as the reign of Henry the Sixth.</p>

<p>Even in a democratic age it is not easy at first
sight to recognise where the interest lies of an epoch
destitute of all that has made other times illustrious,
and whose significance seems to shrink in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
comparison with the struggles and victories of the
ages that preceded, and the splendid achievements of
the age that followed it; and historians finding
themselves face to face with so dreary a century
may have been tempted to give it a character of
its own for grossness, for cruelty, for any distinction
whatever which will at least take it out of
the range of the absolutely commonplace. But the
distinguishing mark of the fifteenth century lies
neither in its crime nor in its vulgarity. We must
judge this period in fact as a time of transition in
many ways extraordinarily like our own. In the
centuries between the Great Plague and the Reformation,
just as in the nineteenth century, the real
significance of our history lies in the advent of a
new class to wealth and power, as the result of a great
industrial revolution. The breaking up of an old
aristocratic order, and the creation of a middle class
to be brought into politics and even into “society,”
the enormous increase of material wealth, the new
relation of the various ranks to one another, and the
failure under altered circumstances of traditional rules
of conduct, the varied careers suddenly opened to
talent or ambition, the reproach for the first time
attached to incompetence and poverty, the vulgarization
of literature and morality which followed on
their adaptation to a class as yet untrained to criticism
or comparison, the extension of a habit of
religion closely related to a plain morality&mdash;all these
things recall to us many of the experiences of our
own days, and may make us more tolerant of the
unpicturesque and Philistine element whether then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
or now. If the chief centre of interest had once lain
in the offices of the royal palace it might now be seen
rather in the new Town Hall which was being built
in almost every borough in England, or in the office
where the mayor’s clerk was busied in making his
copies of Magna Charta or extracts of Domesday, or
in translating from the old French the customs and
ordinances of the town, or in hunting up the rolls of
the itinerant judges; or over the country-side where
estates were being sold and bought with the development
of a provincial instead of a national nobility
and the rise of new men to possess the old acres,
and where the quickening of the struggle for life
was reflected in the stormy conflicts and significant
concessions of the manor courts. The new
middle class of shopkeepers and farmers had indeed
no chroniclers and no flatterers, for it was long before
men could realise how rapidly and completely the
weight of influence was being transferred from the
old governing class to the mass of the governed, and
chroniclers still went on mechanically retailing events
now comparatively trivial and unimportant. It was
not till the next century that they turned from
spinning out these worthless annals to a discussion of
matters really important which had by that time
forced themselves on the dullest apprehension.</p>

<p>The whole interest of the fifteenth century thus
lies in the life of very common folk&mdash;of artisans and
tradesmen in the towns, and in country parts of
the farmers, the tenants of the new grazing lands,
the stewards and bailiffs and armies of dependents on
the great estates, who did all the work at home while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the lord was away at the wars or at the halls of
Westminster. If the century produced no great
administrator or statesman, it did create a whole
class of men throughout the country trained in
practical affairs, doing an admirable work of local
government, active, enterprising, resolute, public-spirited,
disciplined in the best of all schools for
political service. If there was no great writer, the
new world of the middle class was patiently teaching
itself, founding its schools, learning its primary rules
of etiquette and its simple maxims of morals, reading
its manuals of agriculture or law or history, practising
its Latin rhymes, and building up in its own fashion
from new beginnings a learning which the aristocratic
class had been too proud, too indifferent, or too remote
to hand on to it.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> If no religious revival shook the
country, the new society was solving in its own way
the problem of helping the sick and poor;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
earnest in religious observance, it was framing its
English litanies and devising its own plans for teaching
the people an intelligent devotion.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The burghers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
began to perform in the national economy the work
which in earlier centuries had been performed by the
great monastic societies. The extension of trade and
manufacture had fallen into their hands; they were
busied in the gathering together and storing up of the
national wealth.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> They gave to labour a new dignity
in social life and a new place in the national councils.
From the towns came a perpetual protest against war
and disorder; throughout the troubles of the fifteenth
century, civil war, court intrigues, the tyranny of
usurpers and the plots of the vanquished, local raids
of private revenge or of land hunger, their influence
was always thrown on the side of peace and quietness.
Art found in them patrons; illuminators and painters,
architects and bell-founders, the makers of delicate
shrines and images,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> engravers of seals, goldsmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and workers in brass, whether of English birth or
brought from foreign parts, prospered within their
gates; while their harpers and minstrels doubtless
had a part in the musical developement of the country
at a time when English artists set the fashion of the
best music as far as the court of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> They laid
in fact the foundations of a new English society. The
men of the New Learning, the men of the Reformation,
the men who revealed the New World, were men who
had been formed under the influences of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>All this activity was the outcome of the great
industrial and commercial revolution which was
passing over the country. Until the middle
of the fourteenth century, England had been to
Europe what Australia is to-day&mdash;a country known
only as the provider of the raw material of commerce.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
At the close of the fifteenth century she had taken
her place as a centre of manufactures, whose finished
goods were distributed in all the great markets of the
Mediterranean and of the Northern Seas. It is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
wonder that during a change which transformed the
country from a land of agricultural villages into a
land of manufacturing towns, and opened for her the
mighty struggle to become the carrier of the world’s
commerce, the whole energy of her people, thrown
into a single channel, should be absorbed in accomplishing
their enormous task. Every one was honestly
busy in learning either how to make or how to
sell, and in conquering the difficulties that beset
traders as they strove to push their way into
the world’s market on equal or, if possible, more than
equal terms with competitors who had long held
unquestioned supremacy.</p>

<p>From the twelfth century wool had been the one
great export of England, and the one great source of
wealth for nobles, churchmen, farmers, even kings.
So important was its sale that statesmen very early
saw the necessity of securing for the national Exchequer
a share in the profits of the main national trade; and
in aid of the royal treasury they devised in the first
half of the thirteenth century a system which was
quite peculiar to England, the organization of the
Staple.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The Staple was an appointed place to which alone
certain goods might be brought for sale, raw materials
such as wool, wool-fells, skins, lead, or tin, of which
wool was far the most important. Fixed for the first
hundred years in some foreign town, generally in
Bruges, it was shifted from place to place by Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the Third, who from 1353 made various experiments
as to establishing it in England; but finally about
1390, Calais was decided upon as the most advantageous
spot. Thither every dealer had to carry
his wares (unless he was ready to pay a high
tax to the Crown, or to buy at the King’s
price a license for free trading); and he must
carry them along certain appointed routes only&mdash;from
Lincoln by St. Botolph, from Norwich by Yarmouth,
from Westminster by London, from Canterbury
by Sandwich, from Winchester by Southampton, as
the government in its wisdom might decide. In a
kind of secondary sense these places where the wool
was gathered for export thus became towns of the
Staple, and certain officers, Mayors and Aldermen of
the Staple were appointed to control their trade. The
merchants’ goods, first weighed at the point of departure,
must be weighed again at the port where
they were shipped, and sealed with the seal of the
Mayor of the Staple, while to check fraud there was
an elaborate system of official papers to be sent to
the Treasury in London and to the Staple in Calais
for every such transaction of weighing and toll-taking.
Every possible precaution was taken to maintain the
position of the merchants in the European market
by rules which practically forced the wool into the
hands of foreign and not native buyers, so that English
traders complained that their interests were sacrificed
to courting the patronage of the Continent. If, for
example, the chief Staple town was for any reason
moved from over sea to England, native dealers were
absolutely forbidden to export any Staple wares, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that foreigners might be forced or encouraged to come
and take part in the trade. Foreign dealers were
allowed to vote along with them for officials, and so late
as 1445 the English merchants vainly prayed that no
Stapler might take part in election of Mayor or Constable
of the Staple unless he had ten sacks of wool
cocketed at Calais.</p>

<p>In thus forcing all the export trade of the country
through one narrow channel the first purpose of the
State was merely to provide a convenient method of
gathering customs into the Exchequer; and in course
of time it further discovered that this trading system
might be used as a weapon against foreign peoples in
case of quarrel. But the very last object of the Staple
organization was the convenience of the traders. Nor
had the merchants themselves any illusions in this
respect. To them the Staple seemed at its beginning
contrary to the liberties of Magna Charta;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and a long
experience taught them how its provisions might keep
them shut in between the rapacity of those in authority
and the hatred of the farmers who produced the
wool which they sold.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> They could however still
wring a rich advantage out of superficial calamity&mdash;the
advantage to be found in monopoly and corporate
privilege&mdash;and this was developed with consummate
art. The wool trade gathered into their hands
was hedged round with monopolies and regulations,
protected by fixed prices and times of sale. The
concourse of customers at Calais was diligently
maintained; no buyer was allowed to order his work
through a commission house, so that traders might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
be forced to come to the market in person and
do their business. By the charter of Edward
the Third a Mayor and twenty-four Aldermen
chosen by the whole body of merchants absolutely
ruled the Staple trade, appointed officers, supervised
markets, made regulations as to the treatment of
foreigners, the duties of innkeepers, or the general conduct
of business, and administered justice according
to the Law Merchant with a sworn jury of foreigners
or English or both together, according to the
case to be tried.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And since the governing body had
general control beyond Calais itself over all English
merchants, not only in Bruges but throughout
Flanders, while they governed in England through
their local officers, the power of the Staple extended
far and wide and brought all the scattered merchants
under one general organization.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Formidable through
their wealth and power, they could command the
support of English kings and Burgundian dukes
against rival traders. The profits to be made at
Calais tempted the landowners at home,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and all who
were wealthy enough to pay the required dues and
fees flocked into their body, till the great association
at last included all rich wool-growers and shut out
only the poor farmers and people of no account in the
country. Their monopoly was so complete, and their
discipline so effective, that they could absolutely dictate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
prices; and a judicious pooling system took away
any temptation on the part of the members to break
the ranks.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> At last against the original intentions of
legislators they even got into their own hands the
carrying of the export trade, and so long as wool
remained the chief export of England 80 per cent. of
this trade passed through their hands.</p>

<p>But so far as the State was concerned all this elaborate
system for the protection of the wool-trade had
simply grown out of the fundamental conception of
the Staple as a fruitful source of supply for the royal
treasury; and this theory was carried out to its logical
issues. A fixed sum was demanded from the merchants
year by year which they had to pay whether
their trade was good or bad; while in their mercantile
dealings they were terribly hampered by a host of
regulations issued as to the mint in Calais, and invented
by financiers who from the middle of the fourteenth
century were haunted by alarms as to a possible dearth
of gold and silver, and arbitrarily used the Staple as
a means of forcing the flow of precious metal into
England.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Nor was the drain of taxation at all times
legal and regular. Merchants paid money down for
the protection and favour of the king in reiterated
loans or gifts, whether free or forced. The Captain of
Calais, as head of the only standing army which the
English kings then possessed, advanced a kind of public
claim on the Staplers’ wealth for the security of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
soldiers’ pay; and the merchants had many a time
good reason to tremble for their wool, and might cry
in vain for redress if their whole store was confiscated
to pay the soldiers’ arrears of two or three years, or if
militant lords “shifted with the Staple of Calais” for
£18,000 or so for costs of war.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>All these burdens however could be borne so long
as business prospered in their hands. If a Parliament
like that of 1258, or a great statesman like Simon de
Montfort, urged that England should herself become
an independent and self-supporting centre of manufactures,
these seemed as idle words to monopolists
dealing in wool with command of the world’s market,
who saw no need to forsake their easy path to
wealth at a moment when the growth of manufactures
in the Netherlands opened a vast market for English
produce. In the time of Edward the Third it is said
that 30,000 sacks of wool were shipped every year
from English ports.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>But before the reign of Edward had closed, the
exporters of wool knew that they had fallen on evil
days. Trade began to slip from their grasp. The
revenue they paid from their profits to the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Exchequer fell in the few years from 1391 to 1411 to
one-fifth of its former value,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and was still calculated
at this melancholy fifth in 1449. Instead of the
thirty thousand sacks which they yearly counted in
the fourteenth century, they could not at the close of
the fifteenth century collect more than 8,624 sacks,
and in the last year of Henry the Eighth even this
number had shrunk to under 5,000.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Taxes which
lay comparatively lightly on them in happy days, fell
as an intolerable burden when their warehouses lay
empty, and their ranks were thinned by bankruptcy
and desertion.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> At the very moment when all
England was being rapidly turned into a land of sheep
pastures for the endless production of wool, the great
company of the wool traders was finally and irrevocably
ruined.</p>

<p>The wool, in fact, was being sold at home, and out
of the ruin of the merchants of the Staple the cloth-makers
sucked no small advantage. For the great
revolution in trade was rapidly being completed&mdash;the
revolution by which England was turned from being
a country whose chief business was exporting wool into
a country whose chief business was exporting cloth.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The people had indeed long manufactured rough cloth
for common use.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But during the reigns of the three
Edwards the idea had constantly gained ground that
by working up their own raw material<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Englishmen
might easily retain for themselves the profits which
foreigners had till now secured, and manufacturers
were undoubtedly doing a considerable export trade
in the middle of the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Half a
century later, in 1411, the very year when the
subsidy on wool fell to a fifth, broad-cloths are first
mentioned in an Act of Parliament; and from this
time they became the chief cloths of trade. As though
they had been for a while half forgotten by the
Exchequer, the exporters of cloth found themselves
free from all subsidy tax and only obliged to pay to
the indifferent authorities tolls that amounted to less
than two per cent. for natives and merchants of the
Hanse occupied in the trade, and less than eight per
cent. for aliens; and complacently measured this sum
with the tolls of the Staplers&mdash;the thirty-three per
cent. paid by merchants of the Staple, or seventy per
cent. by all other traders,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a tax which perhaps explains
why in 1424 Parliament had to forbid the carrying of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sheep over sea to shear them there. The manufacturers,
too, made alliance with the discontented
wool-growers. A farmer who could sell his wool next
door, did not trouble to send it with vexatious
formalities over sea to Calais; and in course of time
the cloth merchants insisted upon laws which gave to
them during certain seasons the first choice of the wool
before the Staplers were even allowed to enter the
market.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances trade grew apace. Carracks
of Genoa carried English cloths to the shores of
the Black Sea; galleys of Venice fetched them to the
pits of the Venetian dyers; merchants of the Hanseatic
League sold them in the fair of Novgorod;
English traders travelled with them to the inland
markets of Prussia, and gave them in exchange for
casks of herrings in Denmark. At the close of the
century the English Merchant Adventurers exported
about 60,000 pieces of cloth yearly; and in the beginning
of the sixteenth century the cloth dealers
boasted that never before in the memory of man was
so much cloth sold out of England. The 60,000 bales
rose in 1509 to 84,789 pieces, and in 1547 to
122,354;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the dealers claimed further gratitude
and admiration of their country for the fact that
they had “by their industry” raised by a fifth the
price demanded from the foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Meanwhile the
manufacturer was also getting hold of the home market,
as the great religious corporations and landowners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
who had once provided on their own estates for all
local wants recognized the new condition of things,
and instead of making cloth at home as of old, sent
every year far and wide across the country to the
great clothing centres to buy material for the household
liveries,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> seeking from one place the coarse striped
cloth of the old pattern and from another the
goods of the new fashion. The fine black copes of
worsted were favourite gifts of benefactors to
churches, and a patriotic Norfolk gentleman, after
seeing a “tippet of fine worsted which is almost like
silk,” decided to “make his doublet all worsted for
worship of Norfolk.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the growth of manufacturing enterprise
confined to the making of cloth. For a couple of centuries
the iron trade had made of the Weald the Black
Country of those days, and had stirred the Forest of
Dean with the din of its seventy-two moveable forges;
and now, what with the metals and what with the coal
of the country, “the merchants of England maintain
and say that the kingdom is of greater value under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the land than it is above.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> In the reign of Edward
the Fourth when there was a riot among the Mendip
miners, and the Lord Chief Justice went down to “set
a concord and peace upon the forest of Mendip,” it is
said ten thousand people appeared before him at the
place of trial.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But for all this miners could no longer
keep pace with the demands of the country, now that
new industries on all sides required metal that had
once gone to supply the wants of the farmer only; and
though stores were brought from Sweden and Spain,
the price of iron increased to double what it had been
before the Plague.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Shipbuilders at the end of the
fourteenth century were fitting out vessels for foreign
as well as for English buyers. English gunsmiths
began to send out of their workshops brazen guns and
bombards superior to anything made in France, and
which were said to have given England its success
in the French war under Henry the Fifth.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> A number
of towns, big and little, boasted of their bell-foundries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as for example London, Salisbury, Norwich, Gloucester,
Bridport, and others.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The copper-workers of Dinant
had traded with England since the thirteenth
century, and in the fourteenth century had an
entrepôt at Blackwall; but in 1455 the founders
set up their industry in England, stealing away
secretly from Dinant to profit by the cheaper
labour and ready sale in this country.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Flemish experts
taught to Englishmen the art of brickmaking,
and native builders were setting up throughout the
country the first brick houses that had been seen in it
since the departure of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> A whole series
of industrial experiments proclaimed the enthusiasm
with which the people accepted the challenge to secure
for themselves the profits of foreign manufacturers.
Artificers often more ambitious than skilful tried to
establish a native industry of glass painting.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Instead
of fetching from abroad carpets and the tapestry used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for churches, manufactories were set up at Ramsey,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
whence came perhaps also some of the “counterfeit
Arras” which adorned the humbler tradesmen’s homes.
Frames “ordained and made for the making of silk”
were at work;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> lace-makers and ribbon weavers begged
the protection of the government; and English workers
sent into the market large quantities of the linen called
Holland from its first home. The export of raw
material fell altogether out of fashion. Traders no
longer carried skins over sea undressed to be prepared
by foreign labour, but had the work done by English
artizans at home. And whereas at the beginning of the
fifteenth century merchants brought beer from Prussia
to England, at its close they were carrying beer from
London to Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>What with the inland and the outland trade, riches
gathered into the hands of the merchants with bewildering
rapidity, and with results which alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
good conservatives. A statute of Parliament passed
in 1455 lamented the good old days when Norfolk and
Norwich used to employ only six or eight attorneys
at the King’s Court, “in which time great tranquillity
reigned in the said city and counties.” This “tranquillity”
was broken by the manufacturing and export
trade, for now a body of eighty or more lawyers busily
frequented every fair and market and assembly, moving
and inciting people to lawsuits, and while having
nothing to live on but their attorneyship yet prospered
so well that a wise legislature had to order that
Norfolk should henceforth as of old have only six
attorneys and Norwich two.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Nor does it seem that
Norwich was exceptionally wicked, even though in
Piers Ploughman Covetousness is represented with a
“Norfolk nose,”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> for about the same time we read in
Nottingham of twenty-four rolls written within and
without with the pleas concerning trading questions of
a single year. The whole country in fact shared in
traders’ profits from king to peasant. It is calculated
that in the reign of Henry the Eighth English exports
so far exceeded imports as to bring about £50,000
yearly into the country, and the balance of trade
inclined yet more strongly in favour of England under
Henry the Seventh.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Not only did the king lay up
vast treasure, but the very goldsmiths’ shops in
London were reported by a foreign traveller to contain
more precious metals than all those of Rome, Milan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Florence, and Venice taken together.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> So far as the
middle class is concerned evidence of accumulating
wealth is to be found on every side, and the masses of
the people in spite of the drain of war taxation shared in
the general prosperity. In the middle of the fifteenth
century Chief Justice Fortescue contrasts their state
with that of the French commons. “These drink
water; they eat apples with bread right brown made of
rye. They eat no flesh, but if it be right seldom a little
lard, or of the entrails and heads of beasts slain for
the nobles and merchants of the land. They wear no
woollen but if it be a poor coat under their outermost
garment made of great canvas and called a frock.
Their hosen be of light canvas and pass not their knee,
wherefore they be gartered and their thighs bare.
Their wives and children go barefoot; they may in
none otherwise live.... Their nature is wasted and
the kind of them brought to nought. They go crooked
and be feeble, not able to fight nor to defend the realm;
nor they have weapon nor money to buy them weapon
withal.... But blessed be God, this land is ruled
under a better law; and therefore the people thereof be
not in such penury, nor thereby hurt in their persons
but they be wealthy and have all things necessary to
the sustenance of nature.” “In France the people
salt but little meat except their bacon, for they would
buy little salt” unless the king’s officers went round
and forced every household to take a certain measure,
such as they thought reasonable. But “this rule
would be sore abhorred in England, as well by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
merchants that he wont to have their freedom in
buying and selling of salt as by the people that use
much to salt their meats.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>An industrial revolution on such a scale as this
brought a political revolution in its train. The English
population, says a writer of about 1453, “consists
of churchmen, nobles, and craftsmen, as well as common
people.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It was a novel and significant division.
Traders and manufacturers took their places somewhat
noisily beside their fellow politicians of older standing,
filling the whole land till it seems for a moment
as if nothing counted any more in English life save its
middle class&mdash;a busy, hard, prosperous, pugnacious
middle-class. Slowly emerging from its early obscurity,
in this century it had arrived at power definitely, ostentatiously,
carrying a proud look and a high stomach,
intent on its own affairs, heedless of the Court, regardless
of ministers save when it had to bribe them,
irreverent to the noble, the “proud penniless with his
painted sleeve,”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> tolerant of ecclesiastics and monks
only so long as they could be kept rigidly within
their allotted religious functions.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Henceforth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
workshop and the market-place home politics and
foreign affairs were discussed from a new point of
view&mdash;the interest of the trader and the manufacturer;
and the middle and working classes presently
began to fling to the winds the old statecraft whose
maxims had done service before their advent among
the makers of the national policy.</p>

<p>In the matter of our foreign relations we see the
drift of public thought and discussion reflected in a
pamphlet by which one of the King’s ministers,
Moleyns, Bishop of Chichester, sought to appeal to the
popular imagination and define our right attitude
to continental peoples. His Libel (or Little Book) of
English Policy, published about 1445, was clearly
designed for the vulgar use.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Written, as the common
taste of the day demanded, in rhyming form where the
absence of poetic art and the inspiration of a plain
common-sense constituted a double claim on public
attention, it made its frank appeal to the prejudice of
the stall-holder in the market and of the craftsman who
lived by making his homely English wares&mdash;men who
saw in foreign products articles whose sinful extravagance
could only be matched by the worthlessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that distinguished all work not turned out by an
Englishman. With vigorous strokes the Bishop
sketched the outlines of England’s trading interests
with every nation in Europe, and at the end of each
paragraph passionately drove home his moral. Laying hold
of the fundamental axiom that the sole and
undivided concern of England in all her foreign
relations was the protection of her commerce, he
maintained that so long as she kept a firm hold on
the narrow seas between Dover and Calais, she might
rule the trade of the world. For there all commerce
from north to south or south to north had to
pass through the strait gate held by her sentinels on
either side; so that while an inexorable fate drove the
nations into her net, England safely hidden behind
her wall of defence, the stormy Channel, need have
no care so long as she looked well to her navy and
kept it swift to seize her prey and strong to drive her
enemies back from looking over the wall. At its very
outset the commercial society had thus its Cobden to
preach after his kind the doctrine of non-intervention
and the kingdom of the seas.</p>

<p>The exponents of a new home policy pressed hard
on the heels of the founders of a new diplomacy.
About thirty years after the Libel of English Policy,
another “Libel” was composed in imitation of the
first tract.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Less pretentious and elaborate than the
first, the new poem was probably the work of some
person of less exalted rank, whose converse had been
with the working men of the country rather than with
merchants of London or peers of the realm and ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the King, and who was far more troubled about
our industrial policy at home than our commercial
policy abroad. His view of our position was also
finely optimistic. For, seeing that foreign traders
were bound, whether they would or no, to come to
us either for wool or for cloth, and thus depended
on England for one of the first necessaries of life, we,
who were put in this happy position of universal
provider, were clearly “by God’s ordinance,” destined
first to satisfy ourselves, and then “to rule and govern
all Christian kings,” and make paynims also “full
tame”;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and so “of all people that be living on the
ground” were most bound to pray and to please God.
The recognition of these inestimable blessings should
bring of course its corresponding sense of our duty to
sell our goods as dear as we could; to “restrain straitly”
the export of wool so that “the commons of this
land might have work to the full”;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and in any case to
export only the coarsest wool, on the working of which
the margin of profit must be small&mdash;but a fifth in
fact of what might be made on good material. “The
price is simple, the cost is never the less; they that
worked such wool in wit be like an ass.” Above all,
the working men must be protected by law in the
conditions of their labour, so that “their poor living
and adversity might be altered into wealth, riches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and prosperity,” and that for the profit of the whole
realm. The growth of industry was already bringing
in its train a modern theory that “the whole
wealth of the body of the realm riseth out of the
labours and works of the common people.... Surely
the common weal of England must rise out of the
works of the common people.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>From this time therefore the policy of England
was to be the policy of a great industrial state.
But the new way on which its people were thus striving
to enter was not to be a way of good-will at home
or of harmony with the nations. Merchant and
burgher might remain, as they did, absolutely indifferent
to all schemes of mere military aggrandizement<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
such as the conquest of France, so that after the taking
of Bordeaux by the French in 1445 not a single
cry was raised for the recovery of our lost possessions;
and they might rather look for the extension of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
trade to the bold enterprising genius of trading
companies and pirates exulting in freedom from
royal interference and military restrictions, and only
calling on the State for diplomatic aid in the case
where this proved convenient for the winning of
a commercial treaty. But the secret of peace was
not yet found, nor was the settlement of industrial
frontiers to prove simpler than the definition of
military borders.</p>

<p>For as yet England had wakened no jealousies
simply because she had never been a competitor with
other nations; but obvious trouble lay in wait for her
people so soon as they were fairly swept into the commercial
struggle of the Continent, and introduced
by their manufactures to their first real trade disputes.
The weaver of the Netherlands, for example, had
gladly welcomed the English trader as the inexhaustible
provider of his raw material; but it was another
matter when the Englishman came as a rival manufacturer
laden with bales of cloth, grudging the old
supply of wool, and setting up stalls in Flemish markets
to seduce away his ancient customers. The Flemish
towns had seen an end to their prosperity, and towns
in such a case were bitter in negotiations with their
rivals.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Bruges which in the thirteenth century
had 40,000 looms, was at the end of the fifteenth
century offering citizenship at a mere trifle to draw
back inhabitants to its deserted streets; Ypres, which
in 1408 had a population of from 80,000 to 100,000,
and from 3,000 to 4,000 clothworkers, had in 1486
only from 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants, and twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to thirty cloth-factories; and in Ghent matters
were little better. Against all the misery of a century
of slow death in Flanders&mdash;a misery on which
the English weaver throve and fattened&mdash;the doomed
manufacturers set up hasty barriers on this side and on
that, taxes and tolls and municipal ordinances and
State decrees to shut English cloth out of Flanders,
which were met by angry English rejoinders forbidding
Flemish cloth in the English markets. Similar
difficulties followed everywhere the appearance of the
English trader with his goods. The Hanseatic League
drove him out of Denmark, and the Teutonic Order
banished him from Prussia. Moreover while disputes
of manufacturers kept the North in a tumult, commercial
quarrels disturbed the South, and English
merchant vessels met the Genoese or the Venetians in
the seas of the Levant to fight for the carrying trade
of the Mediterranean. No limit was set to the pirate
wars that raged from Syria to Iceland till a great
statesman, Henry the Seventh, made his splendid
attempt to discover through international treaties
the means of securing a settled order for the new
commercial state.</p>

<p>Nor was the question of home politics more easy of
solution. Under the steady pressure of public feeling
the government was gradually forced out of the early
simplicity of its view of regulating commerce as a
financial expedient in aid of the Treasury, and began
to concern itself anxiously about the protection of
industry in the interests of the community. Cloth
manufacturers in particular entered on a period
of protected security such as the Staplers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
never known, when kings became the nursing fathers
of their trade, and its prosperity was considered
an absorbing charge to the government. But when
Parliament began in 1463 (almost the very year in
which the second “Libel” appeared) to concern itself
very actively with industrial problems,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the question of
trade legislation had already become extremely complex
and difficult. As soon as the village weaver
began to make cloth for the Prussian burgher or the
trader of the Black Sea instead of for his next door
neighbour, the old conditions of his trade became
absolutely impossible. The whole industry was before
long altogether re-organized both from the commercial
and the manufacturing side. The exporting merchants,
as we shall see later, drew together into a new
and powerful association known as the Merchant Adventurers.
Meanwhile the army of workmen at home
was broken up into specialized groups of spinners,
weavers, carders, fullers, shearers, and dyers. The
seller was more and more sharply separated from the
maker of goods. Managers and middlemen organized
the manufacture and made provisions for its distribution
and sale. The clothier provided the raw material, gave
out the wool to be made up, and sold again to the
draper.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> And the draper “lived like a gentleman,”
and sold to the big public, despising the lower forms
of trade. Old-fashioned economists and timid conservatives
looked on aghast at the accelerating changes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and declared that the country was being brought to
certain ruin by the reckless race of its people to
forsake handicrafts or the production of wealth, and
press wholesale into the ranks of merchants or mere
distributors.</p>

<p>With this division of labour and the quickened
contest for profits, there started into life rival interests
more than enough to break up the whole
community into groups of warring factions. The
“upper classes” generally, statesmen, treasury officials,
nobles, the greater proprietors lay and ecclesiastical&mdash;in
fact all the wealthy owners of flocks who
could enter the company of the Staplers and share
their profits&mdash;desired an abundant export of wool;
while the small farmers and the yeomen, shut out by
poverty from the association, and bitterly hostile to
the wealthy monopolist, sided with the townsfolk to
whom visions of wealth had first dawned in the
manufacturing industries and the export of cloth,
and who would gladly have kept all the wool of the
country at home.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Merchants and manufacturers
had their own special controversy, for while the
foreign trader was boasting of his energy in raising
the price of cloth, the middlemen and makers at
home, whose whole interest lay in rapid sales, complained
that people in the Netherlands would no
longer buy English goods owing to the increased cost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and that the English towns were thus brought to
destitution.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Moreover the great London merchants
were making a determined effort to force the whole
foreign trade of England through their warehouses
in London, and to shut all channels of commerce
save those provided by themselves;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and demanded
that all cloth for the Netherlands, that is practically
one-third of all the cloth then exported, must
be carried by the maker to London, and there
sold, as was averred, to the exporting merchants
either for credit or below cost price.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Here of
course they came into conflict with the local dealers
who wanted frequent and convenient markets for
their wares, and liberty to make their own bargain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with foreign buyers visiting their town; for to the
clothier this question of distribution was all-important,
since it was in vain for him to increase
production by machinery, or by the improved
organization of labour, or by division of toil among
groups of skilled artizans, unless he could find his
profit in a corresponding developement of the means
of sale. The exporting merchants had also a
quarrel with the artizans, who naturally desired
to keep the dressing and finishing of cloth in their
own hands, while the merchants insisted on the advantages
of a free trade in undressed cloth; in their
judgement the cloth-dressers, seeking but their “singular
and private wealth,” forgot that more men lived
by making and selling cloth than by dressing it, and
that therefore the rapid developement of exports by
carrying out material in the rough to be finished in
the Netherlands was really for the enriching of the
whole realm.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> These same dealers, however, looked
more leniently on the “singular and private wealth”
that went into their own pockets through the profits
of the export trade, and also found themselves set at
variance with the big public of consumers who were
always anxiously on the watch against the raising of
prices. At times the manufacturer had his grievances
against the municipal authorities, whenever he found
himself worried and fettered by the traditional wisdom
of Town Councils, who for a variety of reasons of their
own wanted to keep the ultimate control over his
trade so as to draw a profit for the town. Lastly, the
working class had begun to feel difficulties springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from the new methods of industrial organization,
and troubles about wages and prices and the relation
of employer to employed assailed the authorities both
at Westminster and in the municipal councils. Artificers
of all kinds, it was constantly declared, could
no longer live of their occupation and were in great
misery;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> in fact, to judge by preambles to Statutes,
and the loud complaints as to his condition, the working
man believed himself to be in such bad case as
to need all the aid of the State to keep him supplied
with employment.</p>

<p>This old industrial revolution in short brought with
it difficulties which bear to us the familiar look of our
own constant and persevering visitors&mdash;visitors that
force their entrance at every breach in the accustomed
order by which trade is fenced round, and that appear
as the unwelcome escort of every new form of industrial
competition. Moreover, to add to the troubles
of the mediæval legislator, the consumer of those
days was always insisting on his vested right to the
first consideration of the government, as the ultimate
dictator for whose benefit the whole colossal structure
of trade had been reared, and by whose approval
alone it was allowed to remain at that ambitious
elevation. With every fresh enterprise of manufacturer
or merchant, the problem with which the
law-makers had to deal became more subtle and
complex. Driven hither and thither by the new
conflict of public opinion and the passion of rival
interests, baffled by the insoluble problem of how
to frame laws which should benefit equally all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
claimants for its aid, the government hesitatingly felt
its way along an ill-defined path, veering from side
to side according to the direction of the last impelling
force. Even Edward the Fourth had no fixed
policy of protection, and passed laws now on this side,
now on that, as the imperious necessity of the moment
seemed to demand.</p>

<p>But with a rapidly increasing trade, and with a
House of Commons three-fourths of whose members
were burghers personally concerned in these
questions, it was impossible to stand still; and
the new industrial legislation gradually became the
expression not of the autocratic rule of kings, but of
a self-conscious government of the people.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> A long
series of Statutes illustrates this great experiment.
The new protection devised by burghers and
merchants for the fostering of industry was
altogether different from the old protection devised
by a Court mainly occupied with the problem of
re-filling an empty Treasury. The English manufacturer
and the English working man were its recognized
charge, and in their interest no measure
was considered too heroic and no detail too insignificant,
whether the matter in hand was the closing
of English markets to a whole people, or the
decision of how big a piece of leather it might be
well in the interest of the shoemaking trade to allow
the cobbler to buy for the patching of an old boot.
All native trades were “protected” by laws which
declared that none of the wares which Englishmen
could manufacture at home might be imported from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
foreign parts, and that none of the raw material they
used might be carried out unwrought, or even half
finished, to be worked up abroad. The whole people,
save a few of the “great estates” and mighty men,
must go simply clad in honest goods of English make,
and so save themselves from waste, and English workers
from poverty. As to the long dispute about admitting
foreigners to trade in England, in which the
King and the people had ever been in strong opposition,
that matter was now more and more regulated according
to the desires of the traders. England ceased
to be the acquiescent host of guests who, in the
vulgar opinion, came to thrive and fatten on her
wealth; and a determined resistance was declared
against the competition of strangers, till the Hanseatic
trader scarcely dared show his face outside the
strong walls of his Steel-yard citadel, and the Lombard
vainly struggled to protect his last privileges from the
assaults of his enemies.</p>

<p>The theory of State protection of industry grew fast,
and by the time of Henry the Seventh its triumph
was complete, and the foundations of a new national
policy were firmly laid&mdash;a policy which was to be
largely guided by industrial interests and to represent
the claims of an elaborate industrial organization
established by law and built into vast proportions by
international agreement. The new relation of a
sovereign to his people in such a State was seen
at the end of the century in the first peaceful
king of England whose subjects had submitted
to his rule, the only English monarch till then
who had not been a strong leader in war and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
who had yet escaped murder or imprisonment at
the hands of his people. It has been the singular
misfortune of one of our greatest rulers, Henry the
Seventh, to be the first sovereign of the modern
pattern who ruled over Englishmen, and his memory
has in consequence come down to us shorn of all the
conventional glory that tradition had until then
declared proper to royalty. He has remained in
history as we see him in one of his portraits, a dim
obscure figure, sadly looking out from the background
of a canvas where the big blustering figure of his son,
set squarely in front, seems to elbow all virtue save his
own out of recognized existence. But in the delicate,
careworn, refined face with its suggestion of unrecorded
self-effacement, in the penetrating intelligence
devoted to the apprehending of the new
problems and the infinite labour spent in solving
them, in the inscrutable acquiescence with which,
“loving to seal up his own dangers,”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> he carried
the burdens that were henceforth to fall to the lot
of kings, and the unflinching resolution of his
methods, we recognize a new type of royal dignity,
and measure the work demanded of rulers who saw
the power of mere personal dominion founded on force
gradually passing from their hands, and in the changing
order of the world were called to take up the
leadership of the new commonwealth that was to be.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION OF THE FIFTEENTH
CENTURY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A French</span> proverb of the twelfth century tells us
what the world thought in old days of the origin and
uses of a navy. “Point de marine sans pelerinages,”
men said, seeing in pious penitents its means of support,
and in the shrines of St. James or St. Peter
or the Holy Sepulchre its destinations. Trade in
those days avoided the way of the ocean, and
followed the well-known land routes across the
heart of Europe, and where the land came to an end
took the very shortest way over the water to the next
point of solid earth.</p>

<p>And slowly as commerce by sea developed in Europe
it developed yet more slowly among the English. All
goods that came to them from abroad were carried to
their shores by powerful confederations of foreign
merchants who controlled the great continental trade
routes of the north-west. The “men of the Empire”
or the Hanse of Cologne, masters of the highway of
the Rhine and of Cologne, the great seaport of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Empire, commanded the whole Eastern trade which
then for the most part passed through Germany.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The
Flemish Hanse of London,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> which included all the
great towns of Picardy and Flanders, and perhaps at
one time even Paris itself, carried over sea the wares
that were gathered from half of Europe to the great
fairs of Champagne. Through these two great companies
England first exchanged her wool for certain
necessaries such as salt and fish and iron and wood,
and for a few luxuries such as spices and silks from
the Levant.</p>

<p>And even when commerce swept beyond the narrow
seas and passed out of the hands of the men of Cologne
and the Flemish Hanse, it was not Englishmen who
took their place. If the waterway of the Rhine was
forsaken of half its trade as merchants of Northern
Italy abandoned the old route across Europe, and
instead of sending their goods to the warehouses of
Cologne despatched fleets through the Straits of Gibraltar
to the ports of the Channel and to Bruges; if
the fairs of Champagne languished when armies encamped
on its plains and turned them into battle-fields,
and the Flemish Hanse of London slowly sank into
insignificance&mdash;it was only to make way for other competitors
of foreign blood. Commerce with the East
through the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
seized by the ships of Florence and Genoa and Venice.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
The towns of the German Ocean and the Baltic gathered
under the banner of Lübeck into a new Hanseatic
League<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> which broke the supremacy of Cologne, claimed
the whole carrying trade of the Northern seas, and
opened a new line of communication with the Levant.
Novgorod became the centre of the Baltic trade, as
Alexandria was the centre of the Mediterranean traffic,
and the merchants of the Teutonic Hanse offered to
the English trader the silks and drugs of the East,
with skins and hemp and timber of Novgorod, and the
metals of Bohemia and Hungary.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean merchant was the great minister
to the growing luxury of mediæval England. “The
estates and lords of the realm” and bishops and prelates
and parish priests bought from him cloth of gold,
rich brocades, vestments of white damask powdered
with gold of Venice,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and precious work of goldsmiths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and jewellers, new-fashioned glass, and many other
fine things&mdash;articles that “might be forborn for
dear and deceivable,” grumbled the English dealer
in homely goods of native manufacture. The whole
luxurious traffic down to the “apes and japes and
marmosettes tailed, nifles, trifles, that little have
availed,”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> roused the bitter jealousy of the home
trader; and even statesmen foretold with alarm the
perils that must come to the nation from a commerce
which filled the land with fancy baubles and vanities,
and carried away in exchange the precious wealth of
the people, their cloth and wool and tin, sucking the
thrift out of the land as the wasp sucks honey from
the bee. But in spite of the hostility of English
dealers needy kings anxious to win favour with the
great banking companies of Italy diligently encouraged
the trade; and (always in consideration of adequate
tolls for privileges) freed merchants who came from
beyond the Straits from the vexatious control of the
Staple;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> allowed their vessels to put into port undisturbed
at Southampton instead of being forced to go
to Calais; and their agents to travel through the
country and buy and sell at will.</p>

<p>It was Florence which in the first half of the fourteenth
century took the lead in the trade of the
Mediterranean with England,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and whose merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lent to Edward the Third the money which alone enabled
him to carry on the war with France. But when
Edward declared himself unable to pay his debts and
repudiated the whole of the Florentine loans ruin fell
on the city; its trade was paralyzed, and commercial
disasters ended in political revolution. Bankers of
Lübeck took the place of its financiers as the Rothschilds
of the mediæval world; and ship-masters of
Genoa seized the commerce which fell from its hands.
Though the winning of the port of Leghorn in 1421
brought a fresh outburst of trading activity to Florence,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
though its merchants established depots and
banks and commercial settlements in all the great
towns of the North, though cargoes of wool were
again shipped to its harbour (one English merchant
alone in 1437 selling to an agent of the Albertine
Company wool to the value of almost £12,000),<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> the
supremacy of the Republic in the Mediterranean trade
was never restored.</p>

<p>For its great competitors, Genoa and Venice, were
now fairly in the field. Through their station on the
Black Sea the Genoese held until the Turkish conquest
the chief market in the East for European cloth; and
their fleets laden with cloth of gold, silk and spices
of the Levant, with alum and mastick from the subject
islands of Chios and Phocœa, with the woad of Toulouse,
and the wines of Provence, sailed to Southampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to exchange their cargoes for English cloth, which they
sometimes carried back direct to the Black Sea, and
sometimes took on to sell at the Flemish markets, and
so make a double profit on their journey.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> For their
world-wide business the Bank of St. George was
founded at Genoa in 1407, with a system of credit
notes of acknowledgement for money deposited which
could be transferred from hand to hand.</p>

<p>The great galleys of Venice, however, were formidable
rivals of the carracks of Genoa. For Venice,
hidden away in the Adriatic, with nothing of its own
save salt to offer, showed in perhaps a higher degree
than any other Italian State what might be achieved
by a lavish system of State protection.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> It was the
State that built its merchant fleets; the State that
leased out the vessels every year to the highest bidders
for trading purposes; the State that ordered the conduct
of their business for the greatest public wealth;
the State that protected them from competition by
forbidding its citizens to send out their spices by the
overland route, or to take in cloth from England that
had not been carried in Venetian galleys by long sea.
By the authority of its government Venice had been
made the emporium of the Mediterranean, and Italian
traders obediently carried cloths or tin or bales of
skins from England to Venice, and from Venice to
Corfu. Fortune favoured the most astute among her
wooers, and showered on Venice the coveted blessings
of trade. Her ships travelled far, and Italian merchants
who had once been only known in England as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
financial agents employed by the Papal Court to collect
the tribute due to Rome, now flocked to the
island on business of a very different character. The
harbour of Southampton was crowded with galleys, in
which cunning tailors sat day and night cutting the
bales of material bought into garments, so as to save
the export dues on cloth.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In the time of Richard the
Second a Genoese merchant who had leased the castle
as a storehouse for his wares proposed to the King to
make of Southampton the greatest trading port of the
west, and he might well have carried out his promise
if the London merchants had not prudently sent a
messenger to murder him at his own door.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Notwithstanding
the inhospitable and grudging welcome
given by London itself the Lombards found means
by the King’s help to maintain a thriving settlement,
and in the fifteenth century the Venetian Consuls
gathered letters for the regular mail to Venice once
every month.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>What the Venetians were to the commerce of the
Mediterranean that the merchants of the Hanseatic
League were to the commerce of the Baltic and the
German Ocean. A double strength had been given to
the confederation of towns which Lübeck had drawn
under its banner by its union with the Teutonic Order&mdash;an
order which had originated in Bremen and Lübeck
and then settled on the Baltic to create the trading prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of Danzig and Elbing. These Prussian cities,
while they owned the Grand Master of the Order of
Teutonic Knights as their feudal chief, were still dependent
on Lübeck.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> And with them were joined a
multitude of towns so imposing in their very numbers
alone that when the ambassadors of the Hanseatic
League in England in 1376 were asked for a list of
the members who made up their vast association,
they answered scornfully that surely even they
themselves could not be supposed to remember the
countless names of towns big and little in all kingdoms
in whose name they spoke.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Under the strangely
diverse lordship of Kings, Dukes, Margraves, Counts,
Barons, or Archbishops, they found a link in their
common union in the Holy Roman Empire, and ever
counted England, cut off from that great commonwealth,
as a “foreign” nation.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>In war or in commercial negotiations this mighty
confederation, with its members disciplined to act
together as one body, dealt proudly as a nation on
equal terms with other peoples, and in the strength
of its united corporation it was in fact a far more
formidable force than the jealous and isolated Republics
of the South. Denmark was laid at its feet
by a triumphant war. Norway was held in complete
subjection. It forced the English traders in the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Sea to bow to its policy and fight at its bidding. So
powerful was the League in the fourteenth century,
that when Edward the Third had ruined the banks of
Florence it was the merchants of Lübeck who became
his money-lenders; they were made the farmers of
the English wool-tax; they rented the mines of the
northern counties and the tin-works of Cornwall.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The
whole carrying trade of the northern seas lay in their
hands. It was vessels of the Hanse that sailed from
Hull or from Boston to Bergen with English wares and
brought back cargoes of salt fish;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> that fetched iron
from Sweden, and wine from the Rhine vineyards, and
oranges and spices and foreign fruits from Bruges;
and that carried out the English woollen cloths to
Russia and the Baltic ports, and brought back wood,
tin, potash, skins, and furs. Within the strong defences
of their Steel-yard<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> on the banks of the Thames
by London Bridge, the advance guard of the League
lived under a sort of military discipline, and held
their own by force of the King’s protection against
the hatred of London traders and burghers, which
now and then burst into violent riots.</p>

<p>Thus throughout the fourteenth century it was
strangers who held the carrying trade to England
along the two great commercial routes&mdash;the passage
by Gibraltar to the harbours of Italy and thence to
Alexandria, and the passage by the Sound to the
Baltic ports and so to Novgorod. All the profits of
transit as of barter were secured by alien dealers who
travelled from village to village throughout the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in search of wool or cloth to freight the foreign
vessels that lay in every harbour&mdash;vessels bigger and
better built for commerce than any of which England
could boast.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Moreover, the English government was
content to have it so, and Kings who wanted to build
up alliances for their foreign wars, or to replenish
their failing treasury at home, in all commercial regulations
showed their favour mainly to foreign traders
and left the native shipowner to do as best he could
for himself. Once, indeed, in the reign of Richard
the Second, a solitary attempt was made to encourage
the shipping industry, and the first Navigation Act
passed in England ordered “that none of the King’s
liege people do from henceforth ship any merchandise
in going out or coming within the realm of England
but only in ships of the King’s liegance.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This
Act, however, after the fashion of the time, was only
to be in force for a few months; and after very brief
experience Parliament wisely decided that the law
need only be obeyed when “the ships in the parts
where the said merchants shall happen to dwell be
found able and sufficient ... and otherwise it shall
be lawful to hire other ships convenient.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> With
this the experiment of State protection came to an
end for the next century; and against the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
confederations and State-protected navies of the
Continent English merchants were left to wage singly
as best they could their private and adventurous war.</p>

<p>English shipping, indeed, so far as it existed at all,
may be said to have existed in spite of the law.
There was no navy whatever in any national sense.
A few balingers<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and little coasting vessels lay in the
various ports&mdash;some of them belonging to private
merchants, some to the town communities&mdash;and when
the King wanted ships for the public service, whether
it was to fish for herrings for his household or to fight
the French, he simply demanded such vessels as he
needed in any harbour, kept them and their crews
waiting on his will for weeks or months, sent them
wherever he chose, and laid all costs on the town or
the owner’s shoulders.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Moreover, the unlucky merchant
forfeited his ship to the Crown for any accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that might happen on it&mdash;if a man died, or fell
overboard, or if it struck another vessel or touched
a rock. The masters might suffer ruin, or in mere
self-defence give up the owning of ships, and the
sailors might forsake the sea and turn to other occupations
to escape being impressed for war: government
interference to regulate wages only sent men to
take service at more tempting pay in foreign boats.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
We cannot wonder that towards the end of the fourteenth
century it seems to have been thought more
profitable under these conditions to make ships for
others than to own them, and that builders were selling
their vessels to aliens, and these aliens “by reason of
the excessive profits thence arising have often sold the
same to the enemies of the realm.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Henry the Fifth,
indeed, proposed to build up a royal navy, but his plans
were cut short by his death and his ships sold under
Henry the Sixth, and matters went on as before.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>English traders, however, did not sit down idly
to wait for State protection.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Already in the middle
of the fourteenth century a new life was stirring
in the seaports, and before long every one of them
began to send its contingent to the host that went
out for the conquest of the sea. Towns big and
little were creating or strengthening their fleets,
made up either of the “common barges” of the
community, or the private ships of their trading
companies. Shipbuilding was dear in England from
the want of wood in the country as well as of iron
suitable for the purpose, and cost, if we may believe
a contemporary observer, twice as much as in France.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
So poor communities like Lydd that could not afford
big ventures made shift by hiring vessels from
Britanny, Sandwich, or London, and fitting them out
as economically as might be, with an old wine-pipe
sawed in half to serve for a bread barrel.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> On the
other hand, prosperous ports like Lynn added large
sums year after year to the town budget for shipping.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
A far poorer place, Romney, spent £73 on its common
barge in 1381; in 1396 another was bought and fitted
out for £82; and a third in 1400 at over £40; while
a few years later yet another ship was procured for the
Bordeaux trade. These vessels sailed to Scotland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Newcastle and Norfolk and the ports of the Southern
coasts; or to Ireland for wood, to Amiens for sea-coal,
to Britanny for salt, to Flanders for the wares of the
Levant, to Southern France for cargoes of wine, and
oil, and wood. In 1400 “the new barge” carried
forty-two tuns of wine from Rochelle; in 1404 it
brought forty tuns besides oil and wood, and in a
later voyage carried fifty-six tuns.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Everywhere the
trading temper laid hold upon the people. In Rye,
where the inhabitants had been wont to pay their
yearly oblations punctually on the 8th of September,
there came a time when so many of them were abroad,
some attending fairs, some fishing in remote seas, “that
Divine worship is not then observed by them as it
ought to be, and the due oblations are withheld and
hardly ever paid;” and the day of offering had to be
changed.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The more important side of the movement, however,
was the growth of private enterprise as shown in
the associations of merchants formed in all the bigger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
towns for trading purposes. Already in the time
of Richard the Second there was a “Fellowship of
Merchants” in Bristol who directed the whole foreign
trade and the import of foreign merchandise, and
who even then did business on a very considerable
scale, for when in 1375 Bristol ships laden with salt
were captured and burnt in the Channel the losses
were set down at £17,739. Before fifty years were
over their trading vessels were known in every sea
from Syria to Iceland. The richer merchants built
up by degrees little fleets of ten or twelve vessels
varying from 400 to 900 tons; and one of them,
William Cannynges, an ancestor of Lord Canning,
who in 1461 had ten ships afloat (one <i>The Nicholas of
the Tower</i> from whence came Suffolk’s headsman),
employed 800 seamen and 100 carpenters, masons,
and artificers.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Nor was Bristol singular in its activity.
The Guild of Merchants at Lynn rivalled that of York.
“With the Divine assistance, and the help of divers of
the King’s subjects,” John Taverner of Hull in 1449
built a great “carrack” on the scale of the mighty
ships of Genoa and Venice. Far and wide the movement
spread till the brief tale of 169 merchants
which had been counted up by Edward the Third
when he wanted to borrow money from them, expanded
towards the close of the fifteenth century
into a company of more than 3,000 traders engaged
in sea-commerce alone.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>From whatever town they came these traders with
foreign ports were all alike known to the men of the
fourteenth century by one significant name&mdash;the
Adventurers. For since there was but one protected
industry in England, the Staple, every merchant
who was not a Stapler was a free Adventurer. All
trade that lay outside the Staple was for his winning.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Bound to no place or company or government or laws,
he was left to discover for himself a corner in the
world’s market, and to protect himself on sea and land.
A perfectly indifferent State gave him no help in his
first ventures to become the carrier of English commerce,
and vouchsafed no encouragement to shipbuilder
or master by offers of special favours or grants of
reduced tolls on a first voyage.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> He sailed out of
port into a sea of peril. Pirates of all nations, Vitalien
Brüder in the Baltic and the North Sea, Likedelers
of Calais,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Breton cruisers, vigorous monopolists of the
Hanse, outraged merchants of the South burning for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
vengeance, lay in wait on every quarter of the horizon.
In 1395 Norfolk traders were robbed of £20,000 “by
the Queen’s men of Denmark, the which was an undoing
to many of the merchants of Norfolk for
evermore afterwards;”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and frequent and piteous
were the complaints that went up to the Privy Council
from English shippers begging redress and protection
as outrage followed outrage.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> But a State which
was without any organized naval force was powerless
to establish order. Whether it gave the charge of
keeping the peace on the high seas to the merchants
themselves, or to the Staplers, or by special commission
to the Admirals<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> of the coast, or to a committee
of lords, or to the foremost among the offenders, the
Captain of Calais himself, its experiments were equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
vain. In self-protection town barges and merchants’
ships sailed in companies under an admiral of their
own choosing, armed to the teeth like little men of
war against the enemy, and even carrying cannon on
board as early as 1407, before any kind of hand-guns
had been invented.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> If when disaster overtook them
their masters appealed for compensation to the
government they did not wait solely on the State for
redress; and English rulers seem to have been often
less perplexed to bring a remedy to their sufferings
than to conciliate the great foreign confederations
whose anger had been roused by their swift and
violent retaliation. There were indeed probably no
more formidable pirates afloat than these English
cruisers themselves, for they were hard fighters who
took a prompt revenge; and among foreigners at all
events they won the reputation of using their shipping
for no other purpose than to harass all trade of other
peoples in the narrow seas, and “obstruct the utility
of commerce throughout all Christendom.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Under these conditions we can easily understand
that throughout the century whenever the question
of the English navy emerges in Rolls of Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and Statutes and official statements, we have a contemporary
picture drawn in the gloomiest colours.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Statesmen heap up details to show how badly the merchant
service fulfils its vague functions as a royal navy.
Ship-owners bring their loud complainings to prove
how ill they have been used by the State. Each side
burns to waken the other to a sense of its duty, and
talk of the decay of English power by sea might be
pressed into the service of either, while the loss of
Southern France and the temporary blow which this
gave to English shipping was used to point the argument
on both sides. The sea was our wall of defence,
it was said; but now the enemy was on the wall and
where was our old might of ships and sailors? The
very Dutch were laughing at our impotence, and when
they insolently jested at the ships engraved on the
coins of Edward the Third and asked why we did not
engrave a sheep on them instead, the pun was felt to
inflict a deep wound on the national honour.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Such judgements, however, should be read in the
light of the records which tell us what English ships
afloat upon the sea were actually doing in those days.
For at this very time the unofficial Englishman
seems to have been boasting that his people possessed
a greater number of fine and powerful ships than any
other nation, so that they were “kings of the sea;”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and if the boast was a little premature it lay on the
whole nearer to the truth. Even now the fleets of
the Adventurers were going forth to the conquest
of the seas, and their enterprise marks one of the
great turning points in our history. It was in fact
during this century that England raised herself from
the last place among commercial peoples to one of
the first. At the close of the fourteenth century, as we
have seen, English merchandise was mostly borne in
foreign ships; a hundred years later, English vessels
carried more than a half of all the cloths exported
from the country, and about three quarters of all
other goods,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and the Navigation Act that had failed
under Richard the Second was put in triumphant
operation by Henry the Seventh.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>It was in the Northern Seas that the real stress of
the battle lay. There from a very early time bands
of roving adventurers went cruising from harbour to
harbour to discover what spoils of trade the orthodox
merchants of the Staple or the Hanse had left ungathered,
and how the fertile resources of the lawless
free-trader might be used to shatter these stately
organizations. When the older merchants concentrated
themselves in Bruges and Calais the free lances
of trade sought out the neglected markets of Brabant
and Holland. Driven from the marshes of Middleburg
they turned to Antwerp which the Staplers had forsaken.
Scarcely had the Hanse merchants under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
stress of their Danish wars withdrawn from Bergen
than the Adventurers forthwith slipped into their
place, set up their own Staple, gathering goods there
to the value of 10,000 marks, and for years fought
steadily against fire and sword to hold their own.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
If the Baltic towns fell behind the western members
of the League in maritime enterprize, the Adventurers’
fleets flocked to their harbours, so that three
hundred of them were seen in the harbour of Danzig
alone, carrying dealers in cloth ready to spread
their wares in every market town of Prussia. They
pushed their way into the fish-markets of Schonen,
offering bales of cloth instead of money<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> for salt herrings,
and rousing the alarm of the Hanseatic merchants
there also. By the close of the fourteenth century
they had so prospered in the world on all sides
that they professed to look on large branches of trade
as their own exclusive property, and to make a grievance
of interference with their profits by other “meddling
merchants who were not content with their own
business in which they had been brought up and by
which they were well able to live.”</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a new stage in their history.
The Adventurers now proposed to enter the
decent ranks of recognized associations, and exchange
their roving wars for the more formal aggressions of a
chartered company; and at their prayer Henry the
Fourth granted them in 1406, for their better ordering
and for their protection from other “meddling merchants,”
a charter by which they took as their official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
title their old name of the Merchant Adventurers.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The
grant included all dominions over-sea, and allowed
them to wander where they would in the wide world,
and to draw within their ranks all the Adventurers of
England.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> As yet their organization was loose and free,
and was in fact no true incorporation as a Guild. But
it marked the passing away of their free and stormy
youth. From this time privileges came to them from
all sides by English grants, by gifts from foreign towns,
by protection of the rulers of various countries. Finally
in 1446 they received a new charter of privileges from
the Duke of Burgundy<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> by which their tolls were fixed,
full protection assured to them, and an organization
provided which lasted for the next century. So confident
did they become of their power, that when
Henry the Seventh at his accession raised the tolls required
of them they refused to pay, and he did not dare
to enforce the order.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Seeing indeed in their success
the triumph of English commerce, he remained their
steady supporter, confirmed their privileges,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and when
at Calais they desired greater centralization and a
stricter discipline, he gave them a regular organization
after the pattern of the Staplers under Edward the
Third, with governors and a council of twenty-four
assistants.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Amid all their successes it was little wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that there came a time when they themselves forgot
the free audacity of their adventurous youth. In
their maturer years, as the vehement assertors of
monopoly and State protection, they cast behind their
backs the very remembrance of their lawless predecessors,
and for a braver pedigree they traced their
greatness back to ancestors made respectable by a fabled
charter from King John himself, and boasted of Aldermen
clothed in scarlet who were supposed to have
borne rule over them in good old times in Antwerp.</p>

<p>The legend was the product of a time when Antwerp
was in fact the capital of the Merchant Adventurers&mdash;the
home and centre of their trade. For
there in the fifteenth century they entered on an
inheritance which had been left waste when the
merchant princes of the Staple had finally retired
to Calais, and had thus practically abandoned all
direct trade between Antwerp and England to
private hands. The Adventurers soon solved the
question of who was to carry it on.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In 1407 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
city gave them a House in perpetual succession.
Three of their merchants sat in the Toll-hall with
the toll-keepers of the borough to see justice done
to their brethren. Known among the people as
“the nation,”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> they early showed their power, and
in the first half of the fifteenth century privileges in
the English trade were more and more withdrawn from
the native traders of the Netherlands, and gathered
into their own hands. They used their powers to the
full, governed firmly, ordered the whole English
trade with the Low Countries, dictated what fair was
to be attended, and ruled the prices, in spite of the
loud remonstrances of the unlucky natives.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> At
the great marts held in the Netherlands four times
a year<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> “they stapled the commodities which they
brought out of England, and put the same to sale,”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
and by 1436 they could boast that they bought more
goods in Brabant, Flanders, and Zealand<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> than all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
other nations, and that if their merchants were withdrawn
it would be as great a loss to the French trade
as though a thousand men of war were sent into the
country.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The growing jealousy of the manufacturers
in Flanders indeed threatened at times to cut off their
entire business; and as they were the first to bear the
rising storm of commercial rivalries, so again and
again they were brought within sight of ruin by the
laws passed on either side the water forbidding all
import or export trade.</p>

<p>For in their desperate attempt to save the Flemish
weavers from ruin the Dukes of Burgundy forbade
dressers to finish English cloth, or tailors to cut it in
the Netherlands, and laid heavy penalties on any man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in Flanders who was seen dressed in woollen stuffs of
English make;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> but still the cloth came in, smuggled by
speculating dealers from Antwerp, or scattered broadcast
by licensed merchants who had bought from the
authorities leave to evade the law.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Once in consequence
of political disputes<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> the Adventurers had
to migrate to Calais, and see the legal trade with
the Low Countries given to the Easterlings, a sight
which “sore nipped their hearts;” but first in “disordered”
fashion, then lawfully, they were soon back
at their old occupations.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> With the steady support
of Henry the Seventh, whose whole policy was
directed to develope the trade with Burgundy and
bind England and the Netherlands into a united
commercial state, their prosperity was assured; and
before the close of the century Antwerp, after two
hundred years of struggle for supremacy in trade,
took its place as the great centre of commerce<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> in the
Netherlands, while its rival Bruges sank into utter
poverty and decay. When at last after many chances
and changes, the English won in 1506 through Henry
the Seventh free trade in cloth throughout all the
dominions of the Archduke Philip save Flanders, they
actually found themselves better off in the Netherlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
than the native merchants, paid less tolls than they,
and were in a position whence they might easily overrun
the country with their wares and finally destroy
its decaying cloth industry.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>From their central stronghold in Antwerp the
Merchant Adventurers further maintained a lively
war to right and left, on the one side with the
Staple at Calais, on the other with the Hanseatic
League.</p>

<p>It was practically the jealousy of the Staplers that
had first driven the Adventurers from Bruges, and no
sooner did they feel their strength than they prepared
to make their ancient enemies pay the penalty for old
wrongs. Towards the merchants of the Staple the
very character of their trade from the first forced them
into a militant attitude. Shut out from all interest
in the sale of wool, their fortune rested solely on the
manufacturing industries, and the more weaving at
home was encouraged the greater were their gains.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
And since the wool merchants proceeded both to claim
and to practise the right of exporting and selling cloth
as well as wool, they became in a double sense obnoxious
to their rivals. Now, however, the Adventurers
could fight from the vantage ground given them
by their new position as a chartered company. Out
of their acknowledged right to demand tolls on the
sale of cloth in their marts, they deduced by a liberal
interpretation of their powers the right to require
from each trading Stapler in addition to the ordinary
tolls an entrance fee or hanse of ten marks, by payment
of which he became a freeman of the Adventurers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>’
Company and was made subject to their laws
and courts,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and if he refused to pay they seized his
wares, or imprisoned him till he gave the “hanse.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Wealthy merchants of the Staple who had taken their
wares to Middleburg might find themselves thrown
into prison among felons and murderers infected with
odious diseases; the resolute Adventurers refused bail,
and quietly ignored royal letters of remonstrance.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
Already in 1457 the Staplers complained bitterly to
the English King and to the Duke of Burgundy, that
under colour of letters patent and charters, their
enemies so vexed them both in their goods and persons
as to threaten them with utter ruin.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But the
decision of Henry the Sixth that the Adventurers
were asserting unjust claims which were strictly
forbidden for the future<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> scarcely interrupted the
battle, and the same series of complaints and aggressions
was brought in 1504 before the Star Chamber,
by whose judgement the Adventurers were again
forbidden to go beyond their right of levying tolls.
But if the law was against them they had on their
side their own inexhaustible activity, their unscrupulous
audacity, their large self-confidence, and the
weakness of the dying company of the Staple. Six
years later when the Staplers again summoned them
before the King for their “crooked minds and
froward sayings” and lawless deeds of violence, they
answered with uncompromising contempt. The
Staplers, they allowed, might have certain privileges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in Calais&mdash;but as to talking of rights in Burgundy,
that in their opinion was absurd to urge after the
removal of the Staple thence. Outside Calais the
Staplers had no rights. With regard to their claim
to exclusive jurisdiction over their members, “that
article might have been left out of their book, for
why every reasonable man knoweth the contrary.”
In spite of such “reasonable men,” however, once
more the law was proclaimed to be against them;
but as they knew well the law was powerless to set
up again the ruined company of the Merchant
Staplers.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>With the second and more formidable army arrayed
against them, the merchants of the Hanseatic League,
the war of the Adventurers had to be carried on with
greater circumspection. Through a couple of centuries
the doubtful conflict was maintained on every sea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in every port from Danzig to Iceland. For the first
hundred years things went ill for the Adventurers.
The League monopolized the whole commerce between
the Scandinavian kingdoms and England;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> drove out
the English from Schonen, the centre to which all the
fishers of the Baltic and North Seas gathered for the
salting, packing, and selling of their fish;<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> harassed
them with fire and sword in Bergen, the Staple town
of the north,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> scattering them at one time by starvation,
at another by decrees of expulsion; banished
them from the Prussian towns belonging to the Teutonic
Order which they were “destroying” with their
cloth,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and sought to ruin their trade by issuing an
order that no merchant of the Hanse should buy
English cloth outside England itself. When the
League waged war with Denmark and Norway in
1368-9 to confirm its mastery of the Northern Seas,
it dragged the English traders at its heels into the
fight, and at its close threw them off without a
thought.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> It gave a scornful answer to demands
made by Parliament under Edward the Third and
Richard the Second that the tolls exacted from
Hanseatic traders for exporting goods from England
should be increased; and retorted by a decree that
all trade with England should be utterly broken off,
thus shutting the great market at Elbing to the
English merchants who had made it the centre of
their trade with Russia and the towns of Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The English traders, however, took all misfortune
with the hardihood and exuberant courage of youth.
Help from their own government was beyond hoping
for, so long as conquering kings like Edward the Third
and Henry the Fifth were bound hand and foot to
the great mercantile houses of Lübeck and the Hanse
towns by the loans raised from them to carry on the
French wars; while Henry the Fourth, who, before
he came to the throne, had been in Danzig and seen
the troubles of the English merchants there,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and who
in his anxiety to win the support of the trading class,
was persistent in negotiations to improve their position,
had not the power to give effect to his desires.
The Adventurers, therefore, could only follow the one
obvious course open to them, and kept up a steady
brigandage on the seas and a series of opportune
attacks on the enemy’s out-posts. They held on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
desperately at Bergen,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and stoutly clung to the
formal right which Henry the Fourth had given
them to organize themselves under consuls in Norway,
Sweden, or Denmark, for the carrying on of their
trade.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Fishing boats which were shut out from the
Baltic or from Bergen sailed on to Iceland, where, as
the island was the private property of the King of
Norway (who was himself the servant of the League)
and was allowed to receive no ships save the King’s,
or those licensed by the King, opportunities for illegal
trade were abundant and profits large. A frugal people,
needy and remote, eagerly welcomed smuggled goods
from England in exchange for their fish; and the smugglers
carried on a rough business&mdash;outlaws and daring
men of their company plundered and killed and stole
cattle and desolated homesteads, and bartered after
their own self-made laws.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> It mattered nothing to
them that Henry the Fifth, in obedience to the
League, forbade the trade, or that in a storm of 1419<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
twenty-five English ships were driven on the coast
of Iceland in three hours. Bristol men found their
way to its shores by help of the compass, leaving for
us the first record of its use in England, probably in
1424; and about 1436, in a year when the English
had been expelled from Bergen, so many vessels sailed
to Iceland that they could get no return cargo, and
half of them had to come empty home.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But the
northern trade was not all violent or lawless. English
merchants bought double licenses from the English
and the Norwegian kings, which allowed them to
carry on a regular traffic; and in the middle of the
fifteenth century one of the Bristol merchants, Cannynges,
had in his hands the chief trade with northern
Europe. Not only were his factors established in the
Baltic ports, but his transactions with Iceland and
with Finland were on so great a scale that when in
1450 all English trade with these regions was forbidden
in virtue of a treaty with the King of Denmark,
Cannynges was specially exempted on account
of the debts due to him there by Danish subjects, and
for two years he had a monopoly of the trade.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Adventurers watched their opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to carry the war nearer home, for the League,
already weighted with the effort to maintain its monopoly
before the rise of Scandinavian powers and the
consolidation of the Duchy of Burgundy, was further
troubled within its own ranks by divided counsels.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In
the reign of Henry the Sixth, therefore, the English
renewed among other claims their old demand that the
Hanseatic merchants should no longer be favoured at
their expense, but should be treated like any other
foreigners and forced to pay the same tolls on wine
and wool. There was a chance of success, for Lübeck
and the western towns finding in their strength and
self-reliance arguments for a policy of peace with
England, were generally for amicable compromise;
though the eastern towns led by Danzig, weaker at sea
and peculiarly sensitive to any increase of money
burdens, preferred fighting to submission with its apprehended
dangers.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The party of violence won the day
and a fierce maritime war followed with open hostilities
and reprisals and lawsuits and endless negociations.
On one occasion the English seized a fleet of
108 sail returning to Lübeck and Riga, and the men
of the Hanse retaliated by laying hands on rich
English prizes. Trade was so ruined that Henry the
Sixth declared himself unable to pay to the Count
Palatine the dowry of his aunt Lady Blanche, because
there were now no dues and customs coming into his
Treasury from the German merchants.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> At last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
dispute came to a climax in 1469, when the English
quarrelled with the German traders in London, summoned
them before the courts and imposed a fine of
£13,520,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> while members of the Steel Yard were
thrown into prison, and the corporation nearly broken
up.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The answer of Bremen, Hamburg, and Danzig
was given in a fleet which gathered against England
under the leadership of Charles the Bold. But just
at this moment came the English revolution by which
Edward the Fourth was driven out of the country,
and all the great trading bodies, the Hanseatic League,
and the Flemish and Dutch corporations, seeing the
danger which threatened their commerce from the new
political situation, cast aside minor quarrels and united
to set Edward again on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Such a service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
demanded a great reward; and in 1474 a treaty was
signed at Utrecht, by which the Hanse was given back
all its earlier privileges, and secured in possession of
its Guild Hall and Steel Yard in London, and its houses
in Boston and Lynn. The Adventurers who made a
bold demand that the Easterlings should renounce the
right of carrying out wool or wool-fells from England
can scarcely have expected to succeed; but they at
least gained some measure of peace for their colony in
Danzig.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>The Hanseatic League, however, had now come to
an end of its triumphs. From this time the English
pressed them hard. A law which forbade the import
of silk and the export of undressed cloths struck a
heavy blow at their trade. Then came the order that
Rhine wine must only be carried in English ships.
Officials used their infinite powers of annoyance
with hearty good will, and the merchant who landed
with his goods, harassed first by the relentless officers
sitting at the receipt of custom, and then thwarted in
every possible way by the Mayor and corporation,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
was at last driven by public abuse behind the walls of
the Steel Yard, so that in 1490 a member of the Hanse
dared scarcely show himself in the streets of London.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the great confederation of Commonwealths
itself showed grave signs of falling asunder.
The bigger towns that no longer needed the protection
of the association were quite ready to forsake it, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
1501 began to refuse to bring their cloth to the Staple
at Bruges, and to look for freer conditions of trade. At
the same time the monopoly of the League was being
threatened on all sides. The Prussian and Livonian
towns treated them as enemies. A Dutch fleet
competed with them in the Baltic. A Danish
trading company had risen to dispute their monopoly
in Denmark. The Swedes shut them out. The Norwegians
made intermittent experiments at independence.
At last in 1478 came the worst calamity that
could befall their trade, the capture of Novgorod by
the Muscovites, with the destruction of its free
government and the ruin of its position as one of the
commercial capitals of the world.</p>

<p>With the demolition of the League factory, the loss
of all its possessions in the city, and the whole dislocation
of the Eastern traffic, the supremacy of the
Hanseatic Confederation was shattered, as the supremacy
of the Italians in the Southern trade had been
shattered half a century before by the conquest of
Alexandria. English Adventurers naturally saw in
every fresh trouble that assailed their rivals a new
argument for aggression, and welcomed in Henry the
Seventh a leader equal to the great occasion. Never
had they found a better friend, or one who so finely
interpreted the popular instinct of his time. How
completely his determination to strengthen by every
means in his power the position of the Adventurers
in Antwerp against the Hanseatic traders at Bruges,
and to bind England and Burgundy together into
a united commercial state, fell in with the needs
and temper of his people was strikingly shown after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a two years’ interruption of commerce with the Low
Countries caused by the affair of Perkin Warbeck,
when a burst of popular joy hailed the renewal of
trade, and the wild enthusiasm of the people gave to
the treaty of 1496 which restored the old kindly relations
the high-sounding name of the <i>Intercursus
Magnus</i>.</p>

<p>The big name has, as usual, imposed a little on
later generations, and greater treaties have gone unnoticed
for want of an equally pompous title. At first,
indeed, amid the political disquiet and the trade depression
which marked the early years of his reign,
Henry went to work slowly and patiently, and in
1486 even confirmed the Utrecht treaty of 1474 which
ensured a number of privileges to the Hanse. But
this policy of peace was only assumed for a brief space
while he was making ready for war. In 1486 he
renewed the commercial treaty made by Edward with
Britanny in 1467.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The real campaign, however,
may be said to have opened by the Navigation
Act of 1489, when the shipping trade was definitely
taken under State protection. And what that
State protection implied was at once shown in a
series of commercial treaties with almost every trading
country of Europe, whether its traffic lay in the
northern or the southern seas. Building up on every
hand alliances against the Hanseatic Confederation he
steadily drew to himself the friendship of the Scandinavian
peoples tired of the domination of the League.
In 1489 he sent an embassy (two of the deputation
being Lynn merchants), to make terms for a commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
alliance with Denmark and Norway, and
won from the Northern powers freedom of trade for
the English in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland,
with the right to acquire land, to form corporations
and choose aldermen, and to be under special protection
of the Danish King.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> To defeat the pretensions
of Danzig he turned to the Livonian towns,
and by treaty with Riga attempted to secure a Russian
trade which might open the way of Novgorod
and the East to English Adventurers&mdash;an attempt
which however was frustrated a few years later.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> A
conference was held in 1491 at Antwerp with the
Hanseatic envoys, whom Henry with diplomatic insolence
kept idly waiting for four weeks till the messengers
he had sent to Denmark with friendly proposals
of a treaty as unfavourable as possible to the interests
of the Hanse, returned with their answer. The promise
of this inauspicious opening for the League was
amply fulfilled in the long negotiations which lasted
at Antwerp from 1491 to 1499, and in which the
foreigner was consistently humbled before the triumphant
Merchant Adventurer, all his compromises
rejected so far as they tended to limit the freedom of
the English trader, and the League compelled to accept
terms ruinous to its interests and disastrous to its great
tradition of supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of these Antwerp negotiations gives us
a true measure of the place gained during the last
hundred years by the Merchant Adventurers in the
North, where, having dealt the last blows to the ancient
company of the Staple, and broken the power of the
Hanseatic League, their fleets now sailed triumphantly
on every sea. And yet this was but half their
work; for the North was a small thing to win unless
they could also load English vessels with the cargoes
of the East and the tribute of the great commercial
cities of the Mediterranean. Until the middle of the
fifteenth century the trade of the eastern Mediterranean
had been altogether carried on by Italians.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
It was only in 1432 that the French merchant
Jacques Coeur (the stories of whose wealth and power
read like fables beside the modest doings of our native
traders), had sent out some ships to take part in the
Eastern trade; and the Levant was not really opened
to Western merchants till 1442, when the Venetians
were driven out of Egypt and the monopoly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Italians broken up. It was very soon after that a
Bristol merchant, Sturmys, fitted out probably the first
English ship that visited the Eastern shores of the
Mediterranean. But the new inheritors of the East
were received with bitter jealousies. Rival vessels
fought for the spoils and carried off the booty like
common pirates; and the Genoese traders in their anger
seized Sturmys’ ship on its return voyage and robbed
it of its cargo of spices and green pepper. He
reckoned his loss at 6,000 francs, and on his complaint
to the government all the Genoese merchants
in London were thrown into prison until they should
give bonds for the payment of this sum.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The question of the Mediterranean was thus vigorously
opened. In London, indeed, the Italians might
securely reckon on hard treatment. Merchants just
beginning to feel their strength, half-ruined Staplers,
London shopkeepers and manufacturers, all alike
hated their Italian rivals with a common hatred, and
were crying out for the most decisive measures against
foreign competition. Less careful than their King of
nursing political alliances<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> in view of foreign wars and
complications, the traders boldly proposed a bill in the
Parliament of 1439 to forbid the Venetians from
carrying any wares save those of their own manufacture&mdash;a
measure which if it had passed would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
practically annihilated the whole Venetian trade to
England. Their next proposal was a law to forbid
selling anything to the Genoese or carrying anything
to their port. Steadily supported as the Lombards
were by the King against the people, they nevertheless
saw their privileges from this time limited step by
step; and once after the persecution of 1455 in
London even attempted to leave the capital for ever.
The great days of their trade monopoly were gone.
Edward the Fourth and Richard the Third laid heavy
burdens on them. Henry the Seventh kept them
dependent on his arbitrary will for a very slight increase
of freedom, such as he might see fit to grant
from time to time, tried to limit their gains, and in the
very first year of his reign forbade them to carry
French woad or wine, or silk goods, and further hindered
them in the export of wool.</p>

<p>At this time the population of the Venetian Republic
was bigger than that of all England, and English
traders had a good many other affairs on their
hands beside their quarrel with Venice. The dispute,
nevertheless, did not languish. No sooner were
Henry’s regulations proclaimed in 1485 than English
merchants set sail for Crete, bought up the stores of
malmsey there,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and carried them off to the Netherlands
under the very eyes of the Venetian captains.
Venice passed a law against such traffic, and in the
stress of anxiety as to the English competition took
to building better ships to maintain her own carrying
trade; while England retorted by setting up a monopoly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of her own wool in revenge for the Venetian
monopoly of wine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the quick-witted Florentines, driven
out of traditional routine by the intensity of the
long competition for supremacy, had begun to doubt
the value for them of the old policy of naval
protection which the city had shared with Venice and
Genoa; and had frankly adopted in 1480 a system of
free-trade. In Constantinople and Egypt Florence
began again to hold her own against Venice and to win
back command of Eastern markets, and she eagerly
welcomed English wool merchants to her port at Pisa.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
In 1485, the year when England entered into the lists
with Venice, these had become so numerous and powerful
a body that a consul was appointed over them;
and five years later, Henry made a commercial treaty
with Florence which was one of the most remarkable
acts of his reign. By its provisions English merchants
undertook to carry every year to Florence sufficient
wool to supply all the Italian States save Venice, and
in return they were given every privilege their hearts
desired.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The only resource left to the Venetians was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to forbid that any wine should be shipped from Crete
to Pisa, so that English vessels which went out laden
with wool finding no return cargo should be driven
to sail home empty. Henry immediately set such
heavy import duties on malmsey in England that
the Venetians, seeing their wine-trade on the point of
ruin, bowed at last to the inevitable. The victory of
the English merchants was finally proclaimed when
Henry in 1507 only consented to renew the charter
that gave Venetians rights of trade in England on
condition that they bound themselves to do no carrying
trade between the Netherlands and England, but
to leave that to the Merchant Adventurers.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in all the ports visited by English ships
between the Mediterranean and the Channel the same
buoyant spirit of successful enterprise vanquished
every obstacle. Englishmen had always traded much
with their fellow-subjects in Aquitaine. From the
days of St. Thomas Canterbury had dealings with the
wine-growers of the south.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Ships of Bordeaux were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
known in every port of the Channel, and in 1350, 141
vessels laden with wine sailed thence to London alone,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
while the early wealth of Bristol had been created by
the cargoes of wool carried from its port to feed the
Gascon manufactories, and the casks of wine sent back
to fill its cellars. Conditions so pleasant for the Bristol
burghers were rudely changed when in 1445 Bordeaux
fell into the hands of the French, and English traders
instead of being the masters had to go humbly at the
bidding of the men of Bordeaux with a red cross on
their backs, doing business only in the town, or going
into the country under the guardianship of a police
agent. But if the burghers of the later fifteenth century
cared nothing for the re-conquest of the French
provinces, on the other hand they were determined
not to lose their trade. The wool dealers, shut out
of Bordeaux, turned to the North, to Rouen and
Calais, changed their wool there for the wine of
Niederburgund, and so started the woollen manufactures
of Normandy, while those of Bordeaux
declined. By a succession of commercial treaties<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
and by the Navigation Act of 1489, which shut out
Gascon ships from the English wine trade, Henry
secured for English merchants in Bordeaux such
adequate protection that the efforts of Louis the
Twelfth to limit their freedom of trade by passing
a Navigation Act of his own were utterly vain.
The Bordeaux citizens, filled with impotent rage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
watched the English traders going up and down the
land, 6,000 to 8,000 of them, as they averred, armed
with sticks, and scouring the country for wine.</p>

<p>The ports of Spain and Portugal also were visited
by increasing numbers of English vessels on their way
to the Mediterranean, and old trading alliances were
renewed with countries whose harbours were such
valuable resting places.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> There had long been commercial
treaties with Castile and Catalonia, who competed
for the profits to be won by carrying to England
Spanish iron and fruits along with the wine and
woad of neighbouring lands. But Henry the Seventh
took the occasion of the negotiations for the Spanish
marriage in 1489 to stipulate anew for freedom of trade
and protection of English ships; while at the same
time the English merchants asserted that by the new
Navigation Act the whole export trade was now their
exclusive right, and under the plea that their ships
could not make the voyage to Spain unless they had
a certainty of coming back well laden, forbade the
carrying of Toulouse woad and Gascony wine in Spanish
ships. By this time the Englishman had as usual
roused the fear and hatred of the native merchants,
and the Spaniards violently resisted the new policy.
Heavy tolls were imposed on either side to ruin the
trade of the other, and in one season eight hundred
English ships were sent home empty from Seville
because the patriotic Spanish dealers with one accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
refused their wares to the enemy. Again fortune came
to help the pertinacity of the Adventurers. In 1492
Spain drove the Jews and Moors from her shores. But
their business simply fell into alien hands waiting to
receive it, and the hated English merchants flocked to
Spanish harbours now swept of their old rivals, and
sailed back to England laden with the gold of the
New World.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the good chance that favoured them in
Portugal less wonderful. With the traders of Lisbon
and Oporto England had entered into a commercial
treaty in the middle of the fourteenth century&mdash;a
treaty which was altered in 1386 to include the whole
of Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But by some happy destiny whose
favours strewed the path of English traders, they asked
and obtained in 1458 a revision of old agreements so as
to secure the utmost advantage for their own interests,
and all this had been completed just before the discovery
of the Cape route gave to Portugal its enormous
naval importance and threw Eastern commerce
into a new channel. The quarrel with Venice inspired
the English with increased ardour in their friendship
for the new masters of the spice trade; and when
Portuguese dealers invited English merchants to make
their bargains for Eastern wares in Lisbon instead of
journeying to Venice, these gathered in such numbers
to the new emporium of Indian goods that their
own shipping failed to carry the wealth offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
them and the merchants had to hire Portuguese
vessels.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that in the face of the powerful confederations
that held the trade of the Northern and
the Southern Seas English merchants were laying
violent hands on the commerce of the world. They
had vanquished their rivals in the north, while in the
south they had firmly planted themselves in every
important trading port along the western coast of
Europe, and competed with the Italian Republics
not only for their own carrying trade but for that
of the Netherlands as well. If in the reign of Edward
the Third practically the whole of the foreign commerce
of England was carried in foreign vessels, in
the reign of Henry the Seventh the great bulk of the
trade had passed into English hands. British merchants
were to be found in every port from Alexandria
to Reykjavik, and wherever they touched left behind
them an organized and firmly established trade. As
we have seen, their battle for supremacy in commerce
had in its beginnings been fought by free-traders
and pirates warring against the orderly forces of
organized protection; but the final victory was
awarded to them in their later stage of a company of
monopolists sustained and cherished by the State.
The question, indeed, of how far protection contributed
to the success of the English or to the loss
of the foreigner is far from being a simple one. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
in its first stages the work done by protection may
possibly consist for a time mainly in the <i>abolition</i> of
privilege, and this process may pass by very slow
and imperceptible degrees to its last stage, that of
<i>conferring</i> privilege. It is, therefore, hard to decipher
the lesson when we are studying a commerce where
protection has but begun its work in conflict with a
commerce when that work is perfected. In the history
of the later fifteenth century, moreover, the problem
is yet further complicated by the present working
of those vast forces which make or unmake the
fortunes of continents, and before which the wisest
policies of States, policies of protection or of free-trade
or of any other elaborate product of human
intelligence, are powerful as an army of phantoms.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMON LIFE OF THE TOWN</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> who have been trained under the modern
system have forgotten how people lived in the old
days, when the necessity of personal effort was forced
home to every single member of the fellowship of
freemen who had life or liberties or property to protect.
For in spite of the vigour and independence of our
modern local administration every Englishman now
looks ultimately for the laws that rule his actions, and
the force that protects his property, to the great
central authority which has grown up outside and
beyond all local authorities. He is subject to it in all
the circumstances of life; whether it exercises wholly
new functions unknown to the middle ages; or takes
over to itself powers which once belonged to inferior
bodies, and makes them serve national instead of
local ends; whether it asserts a new direction and
control over municipal administration; or whether,
instead of replacing the town authorities by its own
rule, it upholds them with the support of its vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
resources and boundless strength. By whatever right
the State holds its manifold powers, whether by
inheritance, or purchase, or substitution, or influence,
or the superiority of mere might, he feels its working
on every hand. It is to him visibly charged with all
the grand operations of government.</p>

<p>But to a burgher of the middle ages the care and
protection of the State were dim and shadowy compared
with the duties and responsibilities thrown on
the townspeople themselves. For in the beginnings
of municipal life the affairs of the borough great
and small, its prosperity, its safety, its freedom
from crime, the gaiety and variety of its life, the
regulation of its trade, were the business of the
citizens alone. Fenced in by its wall and ditch<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>&mdash;fenced
in yet more effectually by the sense of
danger without, and the clinging to privileges won
by common effort that separated it from the rest
of the world&mdash;the town remained isolated and self-dependent.
Within these narrow borders the men
who went out to win the carrying trade of the
world learned their first lessons in organization, and
acquired the temper by virtue of which Englishmen
were to build up at home a great political society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and to conquer abroad the supremacy of the seas&mdash;the
temper which we recognize in an early confession
of faith put forth by the citizens of Hereford as to
the duties which a man owed to his commonwealth
and to its chief magistrate. “And he to be our
head next under the King, whom we ought in all
things touching our King or the state of our
city to obey chiefly in three things&mdash;first, when
we are sent for by day or by night to consult
of those things which appertain to the King or the
state of the city; secondly, to answer if we offend
in any point contrary to our oath, or our fellow-citizens;
thirdly, to perform the affairs of the city <i>at
our own charges, if so be they may be finished either
sooner or better than by any other of our citizens</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
Public claims were insistent, and under the primitive
conditions of communal life, in small societies
where every man lived in the direct light of public
opinion, no citizen was allowed to count carefully the
cost of sacrifice, or stint the measure of his service,
when the welfare of his little community was at
stake. His duties were plainly laid down before him,
and they were rigidly exacted. According to the
accepted theory it was understood that all private
will and advantage were to be sacrificed to the common
good, and Langland speaks bitterly of the
“individualists” of his day.</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“For they will and would as best were for themselves,<br />
Though the King and the commons all the cost had.<br />
All reason reproveth such imperfect people.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I. The inhabitants of a mediæval borough were
subject to a discipline as severe as that of a military
state of modern times. Threatened by enemies on
every side, constantly surrounded by perils, they had
themselves to bear the whole charges of fortification
and defence. If a French fleet appeared on the
coast, if Welsh or Scotch armies made a raid across
the frontier, if civil war broke out and opposing forces
marched across the country, every town had to look
to its own safety. The inhabitants served under a
system of universal conscription. At the muster-at-arms
held twice a year poor and rich appeared in
military array with such weapons as they could bring
forth for the King’s service; the poor marching with
knife or dagger or hatchet; the prosperous burghers,
bound according to mediæval ideas to live “after their
degree,” displaying mail or wadded coats, bucklers,
bows and arrows, swords, or even a gun. At any
moment this armed population might be called out
to active service. “Concerning our bell,” say the
citizens of Hereford, “we use to have it in a
public place where our chief bailiff may come, as well
by day as by night, to give warning to all men living
within the said city and suburbs. And we do not say
that it ought to ring unless it be for some terrible fire
burning any row of houses within the said city, or
for any common contention whereby the city might
be terribly moved, or for any enemies drawing near
unto the city, or if the city shall be besieged, or any
sedition shall be between any, and notice thereof
given by any unto our chief bailiff. And in these
cases aforesaid, and in all like cases, all manner of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
abiding within the city and suburbs and liberties
of the city, of what degree soever they be of, ought
to come at any such ringing, or motion of ringing,
with such weapons as fit their degree.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> At the
first warning of an enemy’s approach the mayor or
bailiff became supreme military commander.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> It
was his office to see that the panic-stricken people of
the suburbs were gathered within the walls and
given house and food, that all meat and drink and
chattels were made over for the public service, and all
armour likewise carried to the Town Hall, that every
inhabitant or refugee paid the taxes required for the
cost of his protection, that all strong and able men
“which doth dwell in the city or would be assisted by
the city in anything” watched by day and night,
and that women and clerics who could not watch
themselves found at their own charge substitutes
“of the ablest of the city.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>If frontier towns had periods of comparative quiet,
the seaports, threatened by sea as by land, lived in
perpetual alarm, at least so long as the Hundred Years’
War protracted its terrors. When the inhabitants
had built ships to guard the harbour, and provided
money for their victualling and the salaries of the
crew, they were called out to repair towers and carry
cartloads of rocks or stones to be laid on the walls
“for defending the town in resisting the king’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Guns had to be carried to the church or
the Common House on sleds or laid in pits at the town
gates, and gun-stones, saltpetre, and pellet powder
bought. For weeks together watchmen were posted
in the church towers with horns to give warning if a
foe appeared; and piles of straw, reeds and wood
were heaped up on the sea-coast to kindle beacons
and watch-fires. Even if the townsfolk gathered for
a day’s amusement to hear a play in the Court-house
a watch was set lest the enemy should set fire to
their streets&mdash;a calamity but too well known to the
burghers of Rye and Southampton.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Inland towns were in little better case. Civil war,
local rebellion, attacks from some neighbouring lord,
outbreaks among the followers of a great noble lodged
within their walls at the head of an army of retainers,
all the recurring incidents of siege and pitched battle
rudely reminded inoffensive shopkeepers and artizans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of their military calling. Owing to causes but little
studied, local conflicts were frequent, and they were
fought out with violence and determination. At the
close of the fourteenth century a certain knight,
Baldwin of Radington, with the help of John of
Stanley, raised eight hundred fighting men “to destroy
and hurt the commons of Chester”; and these
stalwart warriors broke into the abbey, seized the
wine and dashed the furniture in pieces, and when the
mayor and sheriff came to the rescue nearly killed
the sheriff.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> When in 1441 the Archbishop of York
determined to fight for his privileges in Ripon Fair he
engaged two hundred men-at-arms from Scotland
and the Marches at sixpence or a shilling a day,
while a Yorkshire gentleman, Sir John Plumpton,
gathered seven hundred men; and at the battle that
ensued, more than a thousand arrows were discharged
by them.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Within the town territory the burghers had to serve
at their own cost and charges; but when the King
called out their forces to join his army the municipal
officers had to get the contingent ready, to provide
their dress or badges, to appoint the captain, and to
gather in money from the various parishes for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
soldiers’ pay, “or else the constables to be set in
prison to abide to such time as it be content and
paid.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> When they were sent to a distance their
fellow townsmen bought provisions of salt fish and
paniers or bread boxes for the carriage of their
food,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and reluctantly provided a scanty wage, which
was yet more reluctantly doled out to the soldier
by his officer, and perhaps never reached his pocket
at all.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Universal conscription proved then as
now the great inculcator of peace. To the burgher
called from the loom and the dyeing pit and
the market stall to take down his bow or dagger,
war was a hard and ungrateful service where
reward and plunder were dealt out with a niggardly
hand; and men conceived a deep hatred of
strife and disorder of which they had measured all
the misery.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> When the common people dreamed
of a brighter future, their simple hope was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
every maker of deadly weapons should die by his
own tools; for in that better time</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“Battles shall never eft (again) be, ne man bear edge-tool,<br />
And if any man [smithy] it, be smit therewith to death.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p class="p1">II. Nor even in times of peace might the burghers
lay aside their arms, for trouble was never far from
their streets. Every inhabitant was bound to have
his dagger or knife or Irish “skene,” in case he was
called out to the king’s muster or to aid in keeping
the king’s peace. But daggers which were effective
in keeping the peace were equally effective in breaking
it, and the town records are full of tales of brawls
and riots, of frays begun by “railing with words out
of reason,” or by “plucking a man down by the hair
of his head,” but which always ended in the appearance
of a short dagger, “and so drew blood upon each
other.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> For the safety of the community&mdash;a safety
which was the recognized charge of every member
of these simple democratic states&mdash;each householder
was bound to take his turn in keeping nightly watch
and ward in the streets. It is true indeed that reluctant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
citizens constantly by one excuse or another
sought to escape a painful and thankless duty: whether
it was whole groups of inhabitants sheltering themselves
behind legal pretexts; or sturdy rebels breathing
out frank defiance of the town authorities. Thus
in Aylesbury, according to the constable’s report, one
“Reygg kept a house all the year till the watch time
came. And when he was summoned to the watch
then came Edward Chalkyll ‘fasesying’ and said he
should not watch for no man and thus bare him up,
and that caused the other be the bolder for to bar the
King’s watch.... He saith and threateneth us with
his master,” add the constables, “and thus we be over
‘crakyd’ that we dare not go, for when they be
‘may ten’ they be the bolder.” John Bossey “said
the same wise that he would not watch for us”; and
three others “lacked each of them a night.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> But in
such cases the mayor’s authority was firmly upheld by
the whole community, every burgher knowing well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that if any inhabitant shirked his duty a double
burden fell upon the shoulder of his neighbour.</p>

<p>III. All inhabitants of a borough were also deeply
interested in the preservation of the boundaries which
marked the extent of their dominions, the “liberties”
within which they could enforce their own law,
regulate trade, and raise taxes. Century after century
the defence of the frontier remained one of the urgent
questions of town politics, insistent, perpetually recurring,
now with craft and treachery, now with violence
and heated passion breaking into sudden flame. Every
year the mayor and corporation made a perambulation
of the bounds and inspected the landmarks;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> the
common treasure was readily poured out if lawsuits
and bribes were needed to ascertain and preserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
town’s rights; and if law failed, the burghers fell back
without hesitation on personal force. In Canterbury
the town and the convent of Christ Church were at
open war about this question as about many others.
The monks remained unconvinced even though the
mayor and council of thirty-six periodically “walked
the bounds,” giving copper coins at the various turning
points to “divers children” that they might remember
the limits of the franchise, while they themselves
were refreshed after their trouble by a “potation” in
a field near Fordwich. At one time the quarrel as to
the frontier raged round a gigantic ash-tree&mdash;the old
land-mark where the liberties of the city touched those
of Fordwich&mdash;which was in 1499 treacherously cut
down by the partizans of Christ Church; the Canterbury
men with the usual feastings and a solemn
libation of wine set up a new boundary stone. At
another time the dispute shifted to where at the west
gate of the town the river wound with uncertain and
changing course that left frontiers vague and undefined.
A low marshy ground called the “Rosiers”
was claimed by the mayor as under his jurisdiction,
while the prior asserted that it was within the county
of Kent; and for thirty years the question was fought
out in the law courts. On July 16th, 1500, the
mayor definitely asserted his pretensions by gathering
two hundred followers arrayed in manner of war to
march out to the Rosiers. There certain monks and
servants of the prior were taking the air; one protested
he had been “late afore sore sick and was
walking in the field for his recreation”; another had
a sparrow-hawk on his fist, and the servants declared
they were but peaceful haymakers; but all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
apparently gone out ready for every emergency, for
at the appearance of the enemy bows and arrows,
daggers, bills, and brigandiers, were produced from
under the monks’ frocks and the smocks of the haymakers.
In the battle that followed the monks were
beaten, and the citizens cut down willows and stocked
up the dyke made in the river by the convent; and
boldly proceeded the next day<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> to other outrages.
The matter was brought to judgement, and a verdict
given against the mayor for riot&mdash;a verdict which that
official, however, lightly disregarded. It was in vain
that the prior, wealthy and powerful as he was, and
accustomed to so great influence at court, appealed to
the Star Chamber to have the penalty enforced, for
no further steps were taken by the government. It
probably judged wisely, since in such a matter the
temper of the citizens ran high; and the rectification
of frontiers was resented as stoutly as a new delimitation
of kingdoms and empires to-day.</p>

<p>IV. Resolution in the defence of their territory was
no doubt quickened by the sense which every burgess
shared of common property in the borough. The
value of woodland and field and meadow which made
up the “common lands” was well understood by the
freeman who sent out his sheep or cows to their
allotted pasture, or who opened the door of his yard
in the early morning when the common herd went
round the streets to collect the swine and drive them
out on the moor till evening.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The men of Romney
did not count grudgingly their constant labour and cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in measuring and levelling and draining the swamps
belonging to their town and protecting them from
the encroachments of “the men of the marsh”
beyond, for the sake of winning grazing lands for
their sheep, and of securing a “cow-pull” of swans
or cygnets for their lord the archbishop<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> when it
was desirable “to have his friendship.” In poor
struggling boroughs like Preston, in large and wealthy
communities like Nottingham, in manufacturing towns
like Worcester with its busy population of weavers, in
rich capitals like York, in trading ports like Southampton
where the burghers had almost forgotten the
free traditions of popular government, the inhabitants
never relaxed their vigilance as to the protection
of their common property.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> They assembled year
after year to make sure that there had been no diminishing
of their rights or alienation of their land,
or that in the periodical allotments the best fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and closes had not fallen to the share of aldermen
and councillors; and by elaborate constitutional
checks, or if these failed, by “riotous assembly and
insurrection,” they denounced every attempt at
encroachment on marsh or pasture.</p>

<p>V. So also in the case of other property which
corporations held for the good of the community&mdash;fisheries,
warrens, salt-pits, pastures reclaimed from
the sea, plots of ground saved in the dry bed of a
river, building sites and all waste places within the
town walls, warehouses and shops and tenements,
inns and mills, the grassy slopes of the city ditch
which were let for grazing, the towers of the city
walls leased for dwelling-houses or store rooms, any
property bequeathed to the community for maintaining
the poor or repairing the walls or paying tolls
and taxes all this corporate wealth which lightened
the burdens of the taxpayer was a matter of concern
to every citizen. The people were themselves joint
guardians of the town treasure. Representatives
chosen by the burghers kept one or two of the keys
of the common chest, which could only be opened
therefore with their consent.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Year after year mayor
or treasurers were by the town ordinances required
to present their accounts before the assembly of all
the people “in our whole community, by the tolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the common bell calling them together for that
intent”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>&mdash;an assembly that perhaps gathered in the
parish church in which seats were set up for the
occasion at the public expense.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> There the people
heard the list of fines levied in the courts; of tolls
in the market, or taxes taken at the gates or in the
harbour; of the “maltodes,” or sums paid on commodities
for sale; of the “scot” levied on the property
of individuals; of the “lyvelode” or livelihood,
an income tax on rates or profits earned. They
learned what means the corporation had taken of increasing
the common revenue; whether it had
ordered a “church-ale,” or an exhibition of dancing
girls, or a play of Robin Hood;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> what poor relief had
been given in the past year;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> what public loans with
judicious usury of over ten per cent., it had allowed,
as when in Lydd “the jurats one year lent Thomas
Dygon five marks from the common purse when going
to the North Sea, and he repaid the same well and
trustily and paid an increase thereon seven shillings;”
or they were told whether the Town Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
proposed to do a little trading for the good of the
community; and how a “common barge” had been
built with timber bought at one town, cables and
anchors at another, pitch and canvas at a third; and
how, when the ship was finished, the corporation paid
for a modest supply of “bread and ale the day the
mast was set in the barge,” before it was sent out to
fish for herrings or to speculate in a cargo of salt
or wine, for the profit of the public treasury.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Lessons in common financial responsibility had been
early forced on the burghers everywhere by the legal
doctrine that the whole body might be held responsible
for the debt of one of its members, while each member
on his part was answerable for the faults of his fellows,
whether singly or collectively. Thus when Norwich
failed in paying debts due to the King in 1286, the
sheriff of Norfolk was ordered to enter the liberty
and distrain twelve of the richer and more discreet
persons of the community;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and when the rent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Southampton was in arrears, one of its burgesses was
thrown into the Fleet in London.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Under such a
system as this the ordinary interest of citizens in
questions of taxation and expenditure was greatly
quickened. The municipalities were stern creditors.
If a man did not pay his rent for the King’s ferm the
doors and windows of his house were taken off, everyone
in it turned out, and the house stood empty for
a year and a day or even longer before the doors
might be redeemed in full court, or before it passed
to the next heir.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> But it was probably rather owing
to the happy circumstances of the English towns
than to the vigilance of the burghers that there
is no case in England of a disaster which was but
too common in France&mdash;the disaster of a borough
falling into bankruptcy, and through bankruptcy
into servitude and political ruin.</p>

<p>VI. In the town communities of the middle ages all
public works were carried out by what was in fact
forced labour of the whole commonalty. If the boroughs
suffered little from government interference neither
could they look for help in the way of state aid or
state loans; and as the burgher’s purse in early days
was generally empty he had to give of the work of
his hands for the common good. In Nottingham
“booners”&mdash;that is the burgesses themselves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
substitutes whom they provided to take their place&mdash;repaired
the highways and kept the streets in order.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
The great trench dug at Bristol to alter the course
of the Frome was made “by the manœuvre of all
the commonalty as well of Redcliffe ward as of the
town of Bristol.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> When Hythe in 1412 sent for a
Dutch engineer to make a new harbour, all the
inhabitants were called out in turn to help at the
“Delveys” or diggings. Sundays and week days alike
the townsmen had to work, dining off bread and ale
provided by the corporation for the diggers, and if they
failed to appear they were fined fourpence a day.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
In the same way Sandwich engaged a Hollander
to superintend the making of a new dyke for the
harbour; the mayor was ordered to find three workmen
to labour at it, every jurat two, and each member
of the Common Council one man; while all other
townsmen had to give labour or find substitutes
according to their ability. The jurats were made
overseers, and were responsible for the carrying
out of the work; and so successfully was the whole
matter managed that in 1512 the Sandwich haven
was able to give shelter to 500 or 600 hoys.</p>

<p>Forced labour such as this could of course only be
applied to works where skilled artificers were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
necessary; but occasions soon multiplied when the
town mob had to be replaced by trained labourers,
and we already see traces of a transitional system
in the making of the Hythe harbour, where the
municipality had to engage hired labour for such work
as could not be done by the burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> But undertakings
for which scientific skill was needed sorely
taxed local resources, and the burghers were driven
to make anxious appeals to public charity. In 1447,
when Bridport wanted to improve its harbour, collectors
were sent all over the country to beg for
money; indulgences of forty or a hundred days were
promised to subscribers by archbishops and bishops;
and a copy of the paper carried by one of the collectors
gives the sum of the masses said for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in the year as amounting to nearly four thousand:
“the sum of all other good prayers no man knoweth
save only God alone.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The building and repairing
of bridges as being also work that demanded science
and skilled labour involved serious cost. When the
King had allowed the bridge at Nottingham to fall
into the river, he generously transferred its ownership
and the duty of setting it up again to the
townspeople; who appointed wardens and kept elaborate
accounts and bore grievous anxiety, till finding
its charges worse than all their ordinary town expenses
they at last fell to begging also. So also the
mayor of Exeter prayed for help in the matter of the
bridge there, which had been built by a wealthy
mayor and was “of the length or nigh by, and of the
same mason work as London Bridge, housing upon
except; the which bridge openly is known the
greatest costly work and most of alms-deeds to help
it in all the west part of England.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Such instances
reveal to us the persistent difficulties that beset a
world where primitive methods utterly failed to meet
new exigencies, and where the demand for technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
quality in work was beginning to lead to new
organizations of labour. Meanwhile the burghers
had to fight their own way with no hope of grants
in aid from the state, and little to depend on save
the personal effort of the whole commonalty.</p>

<p>VII. The townspeople all took their part not only
in the serious and responsible duties of town life but
apparently in an incessant round of gaieties as well.
All the commons shared in supporting the minstrels
and players of the borough. The “waits” (so called
from the French word guet) were originally and still
partly remained watchmen of the town, but it was in
their character of minstrels, “who go every morning
about the town piping,” that they were paid by pence
collected by the wardmen from every house.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Every
town moreover had its particular play, which was
acted in the Town Hall, or the churchyard, before the
Mayor and his brethren sitting in state, while the
whole town kept holiday. In 1411 there was a great
play, <i>From the Beginning of the World</i>, at the
Skinner’s well in London, “that lasted seven days
continually, and there were the most part of the lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and gentles of England.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> At Canterbury the chief
play was naturally <i>The Martyrdom of S. Thomas</i>.
The cost is carefully entered in the municipal account
books&mdash;charges for carts and wheels, flooring, hundreds
of nails, a mitre, two bags of leather containing
blood which was made to spout out at the
murder, linen cloth for S. Thomas’ clothes, tin foil and
gold foil for the armour, packthread and glue, coal to
melt the glue, alb and amys, knights’ armour, the hire
of a sword, the painting of S. Thomas’ head, an angel
which cost 22d., and flapped his wings as he turned
every way on a hidden wynch with wheels oiled with
soap. When all was over the properties of the
pageant were put away in the barn at S. Sepulchre’s
Nunnery, and kept safely till the next year at a
charge of 16d. The Canterbury players also acted in
the <i>Three Kings of Cologne</i> at the Town Hall, where
the kings, attended by their henchmen, appeared
decorated with strips of silver and gold paper and
wearing monks’ frocks. The three “beasts” for the
Magi were made out of twelve ells of canvas distended
with hoops and laths, and “painted after nature”;
and there was a castle of painted canvas which cost
3s. 4d. The artist and his helpers worked for six
days and nights at these preparations and charged
three shillings for their labour, food, fire and candle.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Minstrels and harpers and pipers and singers and
play-actors, who stayed at home through the dark
winter days “from the feast of all Saints to the feast
of the Purification,” to make music and diversion for
their fellow citizens, started off on their travels when
the fine weather came, and journeyed from town to
town giving their performances, and rewarded at the
public expense with a gift of 6s. 8d. or 3s. 4d., and
with dinner and wine “for the honour of the town.”<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
It was an easy life&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“Some mirth to make as minstrels conneth (know),<br />
That will neither swynke (toil) nor sweat, but swear great oaths,<br />
And find up foul fantasies and fools them maken,<br />
And have wit at will to work if they would.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Entries in the town accounts of Lydd give some
idea of the constant visits of these wandering troops,
and of the charges which they made upon the town
treasure.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Players from Romney came times without
number, others from Rukinge, Wytesham, Herne,
Hamme, Appledore, Stone, Folkestone, Rye; and
besides these came the minstrels of the great lords, the
King, the Duke of Somerset, the Duke of Buckingham,
Lord De Bourchier, Lord Fiennes, the Earl of Warwick,
the Duke of York, Lord Arundel, Lord Exeter, Lord
Shrewsbury, the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Dacres, etc.;
all of whom doubtless the town dared not refuse to
entertain, but “for love of their lords lythen (listen
to) them at feasts.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Besides this Lydd had its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
special plays, <i>The May</i> and <i>The Interlude of Our
Lord’s Passion</i>, and the whole town would gather on
a Sunday to hear the actors, while watchmen were
paid to keep guard on the shore against a surprise of
the French. Its players seem to have set the fashion
in the neighbourhood; the Romney Corporation
“chose wardens to have the play of <i>Christ’s Passion</i>,
as from olden time they were wont to have it,” and
paid the expenses of a man to go to Lydd “to see the
original of our play there,” besides giving the Lydd
players a reward of 20s. for their performance.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Other wanderers too knocked at the gates of Lydd&mdash;”the
man with the dromedary,” a “bear-ward,” or
the keeper of the King’s lions travelling with his menagerie
and demanding a sheep to be given to the lions;
archers and wrestlers from neighbouring towns whom
Jurats and Commons gathered to see, and supplied
with wrestling collars and food for themselves and their
horses, as well as a “reward” at the public expense.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Besides bull-baiting, Lydd, doubtless, like other towns,
had its occasional “bear-baiting.” There were the
Christmas games and mumming, and the yearly visit
of the “Boy Bishop”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> of S. Nicholas who came from
Romney to hold his feast at Lydd. And there was
the universal festival of the “watch” on S. John’s
Eve, when Lydd paid out of its common chest for the
candles kept burning all night in the Common House,
and for the feast&mdash;not a trifling expense if we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
judge by the case of Bristol where the crafts who took
part in the watch divided among them ninety-four
gallons of wine.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>This festival was observed everywhere, but other
local feasts were arranged according to local traditions.
In Canterbury every Mayor was bound “to keep the
watch” on the Eve of the Translation of S. Thomas.
“And in the aforesaid watch the Sheriff to ride in
harness with a henchman after him honestly emparelled
for the honour of the same city. And the
Mayor to ride at his pleasure, and if the Mayor’s
pleasure be to ride in harness, the Aldermen to ride
in like manner, and if he ride in his scarlet gown, the
Aldermen to ride after the same watch in scarlet and
crimson gowns.” The city was to be lighted by the
Mayor finding “two cressets, or six torches, or more at
his pleasure,” every Alderman finding two cressets, and
each of the Common Council with every constable and
town clerk one cresset. In Chester the great day
for merry making was Shrove Tuesday, when the drapers,
saddlers, shoemakers and many others met at the
cross on the Roodeye, and there in the presence of the
Mayor the shoemakers gave to the drapers a football
of leather “to play at from thence to the Common
Hall.” The saddlers at the same time gave “every
master of them a painted ball of wood with flowers
and arms upon the point of a spear, being goodly
arrayed upon horseback accordingly.” The whole town
joined in the sports, and everyone married within the
year gave some contribution toward their funds.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>To these festivities we must add the yearly pageants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the Guilds&mdash;whether of the great societies like the
Guild of St. George at Norwich,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> whose Alderman in
scarlet robe followed by the four hundred members
with their distinguishing red hoods, marched after the
sword of wood with a Dragon’s head for the handle
which had been presented to them by Henry the Fifth;&mdash;or
of the Corpus Christi Guild which evidently
played a political part in the life of every great town.
In York it is said to have had in the sixteenth century
nearly fifteen thousand members, and at its great
pageant, the Mayor and Town Council “and other
worshipful persons” joined in a common feast, and
sent wine and fruits at the public expense to great
nobles and ladies in the city, till perhaps supplies ran
out and the town was “drunken dry.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The Craft
Guilds also, whether voluntarily or by order of the
Corporation, had their pageants, acting the same play
year after year.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>It has been commonly supposed that the English
people had in the later middle ages a passion for
pageantry and display, which was one of the strongest
forces in maintaining their guild organization. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
towards the end of the fifteenth century at least it
becomes less and less clear that the freewill of the
craftsmen had much to say to the maintenance of these
public gaieties, or that they felt any enthusiasm for
amusements which yearly grew more expensive and
burdensome.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> There were places where the crafts,
whether through poverty or economy, neglected to
spend a due proportion of their earnings on the public
festivals, and in one town after another as popular
effort declined the authorities began to urge the people
on to the better fulfilment of their duties. In 1490
a complaint was made in Canterbury that the Corpus
Christi Play, the City Watch on S. Thomas’ Eve, and
the Pageant of S. Thomas had fallen into decay. Some
Mayors indeed “in their year have full honourably kept
the said watch;” but others had neglected it, and
“all manner of harness within the city is decayed and
rusted for lack of the yearly watch.” It was therefore decreed
that every Mayor should henceforth “keep the
watch,” and that the crafts who apparently hoped to escape
from the heavy charges of these plays by declaring
themselves too poor to be formed into a corporate body,
should forthwith be grouped together into a sort of
confederation or give up their bodies for punishment.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
In the same way when the tailors of Plymouth were incorporated
in 1496, they had to bind themselves to provide
a pageant every year on Corpus Christi Day for the
benefit of the Corpus Christi Guild,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and so on in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
other towns. Occasionally indeed the Corporation
took a different and more merciful line; for the Mayor
and Sheriffs of Norwich petitioned the Lords and
Commons to pass an Act or Order to prevent Players
of Interludes from coming into the city, as they took
so large a share of the earnings of the poor operatives
as to cause great want to their families, and a heavy
charge to the city,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and Bridgenorth got an order
from Elizabeth that the town might no longer pay
players or bear-wards; whoever wanted to see such
things must see them “upon their own costs and
charges.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>On the whole it is evident that long before the
Reformation, and even when as yet no Puritan
principles had been imported into the matter, the
gaiety of the towns was already sobered by the pressure
of business and the increase of the class of
depressed workers. It was not before the fanaticism
of religion, but before the coming in of new forms of
poverty and of bondage that the old games and
pageants lost their lustre and faded out of existence,
save where a mockery of life was preserved to them
by compulsion of the town authorities. And the town
authorities were probably acting under pressure of
the publicans, and licensed victuallers. Cooks and
brewers and hostellers<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> were naturally deeply interested
in the preservation of the good old customs, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was in some cases certainly this class, the most powerful
in a mediæval borough, who raised the protest
against the indifference and neglect of the townspeople
for public processions and merry-making,
because “thereby the victuallers lose their money,
and who insisted on the revival of these festivals for the
encouragement of trade. Probably where the crafts
were strong and the votes of the working people
carried the day, the decision turned the other way.</p>

<p>VIII. All the multitudinous activities and accidents
of this common life were summed up for the
people in the parish church that stood in their market-place,
close to the Common House or Guild Hall. This
was the fortress of the borough against its enemies&mdash;its
place of safety where the treasure of the commons
was stored in dangerous times, the arms in the steeple,
the wealth of corn or wool or precious goods<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> in the
church itself,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> guarded by a sentence of excommunication
against all who should violate so sacred a
protection.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Its shrines were hung with the strange
new things which English sailors had begun to bring
across the great seas&mdash;with “horns of unicorns,” ostrich
eggs, or walrus tusks, or the rib of a whale given by
Sebastian Cabot. From the church tower the bell
rang out which called the people to arm for the
common defence, or summoned a general assembly,
or proclaimed the opening of the market.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Burghers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had their seats in the church apportioned to them by
the corporation in the same rank and order as the stalls
which it had already assigned to them in the market-place.
The city officers and their wives sat in the
chief places of honour; next to them came tradesmen
according to their degree with their families honourably
“y-parroked (parked) in pews,” where Wrath
sat among the proud ladies who quarrelled as to
which should first receive the holy bread;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> while
“apprentices and servants shall sit or stand in the
alleys.” There on Sundays and feast-days the people
came to hear any news of importance to the community,
whether it was a list of strayed sheep, or a
proclamation by the bailiff of the penalties which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
been decreed in the manor court against offenders.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
The church was their Common Hall where the commonalty
met for all kinds of business, to audit the
town accounts, to divide the common lands, to make
grants of property, to hire soldiers, or to elect a
mayor. There the council met on Sundays or
festivals, as might best suit their convenience; so
that we even hear of a payment made by the priest
to the corporation to induce them not to hold their
assemblies in the chancel while high mass was being
performed.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> It was the natural place for justices to
sit and hear cases of assault and theft; or it might
serve as a hall where difficult legal questions could be
argued out by lawyers. In the middle of the fifteenth
century when the Bishop and the Mayor of Exeter
were in the height of a fierce contest about the
government of the town they met for discussion in
the cathedral. “When my lord had said his prayers
at the high altar he went apart to the side altar by
himself and called to him apart the mayor and no
more, and there communed together a great while.”
And on this common ground the dean and chapter on
the one side and the mayor and Town Council on the
other, attended by their respective lawyers, fought
out the questions of law on which the case turned.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
In fair time the throng of traders expected to be allowed
to overflow from the High Street into the cathedral
precincts, and were “ever wont and used ... to
lay open, buy and sell divers merchandises in the
said church and cemetery and special in the king’s
highway there as at Wells, Salisbury and other
places more, as dishes, bowls, and other things like,
and in the said church ornaments for the same and
other jewels convenient thereto.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In a draft presentation
to a London vicarage of 1427 there is
a written memorandum with an order from
the king that no fairs or markets shall be held in
sanctuaries, “for the honour of Holy Church.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Edward the First had indeed forbidden such fairs
in his Statute of Merchants, but such an order was
little in harmony with the habits and customs of the
age; and if there was an occasional stirring of conscience
in the matter, it was not till the time of Laud
that the public attained to a conviction, or acquiesced
in an authoritative assertion, that the church was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
desecrated by the transaction in it of common business.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>In the middle ages however the townspeople were
connected with their parish church after a fashion
which has long been unknown among us. They were
frequently the lay rectors; they appointed the wardens
and churchwardens; they had control of the funds,
and the administration of lands left for maintaining
its services and fabric; sometimes they laid claim to
the fees paid for masses.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The popular interest
might even extend to the criticism and discipline of the
rector; so that in Bridport an enquiry of the bishop as
to whether his chaplain, “a foreigner from Britanny,”
was “drunk every day” was held in presence of “a
copious multitude of the parishioners,” and twelve
townsmen acted as witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> If a religious guild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had become identified with the corporation, the town
body and the Church were united by a yet closer tie.
The corporation of Plymouth, which on its other
side was the Guild of our Lady and St. George,
issued its instructions even as to the use of vestments
in St. Andrews, ruling when “the best copes
and vestments” should be used at funerals, and how
“the second blue copes” only might be displayed
at the burial of any man who died without leaving
to the Church an offering of twenty shillings.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The people on their side were taxed, and heavily
taxed, for the various expenses of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Sergeants
sent by the Town Council collected under severe
penalties the dues for the blessed bread and “trendilles”
of wax, or “light-silver” for the lights burned
beside dead bodies laid in the church; and the town
treasury paid for “coals for the new fire on Easter
Eve.”<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> If a church had to be repaired or rebuilt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
pressure of spiritual hopes or fears, the habit of public
duty, the boastfulness of local pride, all the influences
that might stimulate the common effort, were raised
to their highest efficiency by the watchful care of the
corporation. All necessary orders were sent out by
the mayor, who with the Town Council determined the
share which the inhabitants were to take in the work;
and in small and destitute parishes where the principle
of self-help and independence was quite as fully recognized
as it was in bigger and richer towns, real
sacrifices were demanded. Men gave their money or
their labour or the work of their horse and cart, or
they offered a sheep or fowls, or perhaps rings and
personal ornaments.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> In the pride of their growing
municipal life the poorest boroughs built new towers
and hung new chimes worthy of the latest popular
ideals. The inhabitants of Totnes were so poor
that in 1449 there were only three people in
the town who paid as much as twentypence for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
tax of half-tenths and fifteenths for the King. But
since Totnes had four new bells which had been
anointed and consecrated in 1442, it decided that the
old wooden belfry of the parish church should be replaced
by a new stone tower. A master mason was
appointed in 1448, and “supervisors” were chosen
to visit the bell towers of all the country round and
to make that at Totnes “according to the best model.”
The proctors of the church provided shovels and pick-axes,
and the parishioners were called out to dig stones
from the quarry; every one who had a horse was to
help in carrying the stones, “but without coercion,”
while “those who have no horses of their own are to
work with the horses of other persons, but at their
own cost.” Last of all an ordinance was made that the
mayor, vicar, and proctors of the church should go
round to each parishioner and see how much he would
give to the collection on Sundays for the bell tower,
and those who contributed nothing were to have
their names entered on a roll and sent to the Archdeacon’s
Court.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> When St. Andrews at Plymouth was
enlarged the town authorities decided that the money
should be collected by means of a yearly “church-ale.”
Taverns were closed by order of the council
on a certain day, and every ward of the town
made for itself a “hale” or booth in the cemetery
of the parish church. All inhabitants of the wards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
were commanded to come with as many friends and
acquaintances as possible “for the increasing of the
said ale,” and to bring with them “except bread and
drink such victual as they like best”; but they must
buy at the “hale” “bread and ale as it cometh
thereto for their dinners and suppers the same day.”
After ten years of these picnics in the churchyard
the new aisle of St. Andrews was finished at a cost of
£44 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of this busy life&mdash;a life where the
citizens themselves watched over their boundaries,
defended their territory, kept peace in their borders,
took charge of the common property, governed the
spending of the town treasure, laboured with their
own hands at all public works, ordered their own
amusements, the mediæval burgher had his training.
The claims of the commonwealth were never
allowed to slip from his remembrance. As all the
affairs of the town were matters of public responsibility,
so all the incidents of its life were made matters
of public knowledge. The ancient “common horn”
or the “common bell”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> announced the opening of
the market, or the holding of the mayor’s court,
or called the townspeople together in time of
danger. Criers went about the streets to proclaim
the ordinances of the community, and to remind
the citizens of their duties. From the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
stile or in the market-place they summoned men to
the King’s muster, or called them to their place in
the town’s ship or barge; or if danger from an enemy
threatened, warned the citizens “to have harness
carried to the proper places,” or “to have cattle or
hogs out of the fields.” They exhorted the people
“to leave dice-playing,” “to cease ball-playing and
to take to bows;” to shut the shops at service time;
“to have water at men’s doors” for fear of fire. The
crier “called” any proclamation of the King in the
public places of the town; he declared deeds of pardon
granted to any criminal, or proclaimed that some poor
wretch who had taken sanctuary in the church had
abjured the kingdom and was to be allowed to depart
safely through the streets. Perhaps the “cry” was
made that a prisoner had been thrown into the town
gaol on suspicion, and accusers were called to appear
if they had any charge to bring against him; or it
was announced that the will of a deceased townsman
was about to be proved in the court-house, if there
were any who desired to raise objections; or there was
proclamation that a burgher had offended against
the laws of the community and was degraded from the
freedom of the town, or perhaps banished for ever
from its territory. At other times players and minstrels
would pass through the market-place and streets
“crying the banns” of their plays. The merchant,
the apprentice, the journeyman, the shopkeeper,
gathered in the same crowd to hear the crier who
recorded every incident in the town life or brought
tidings of coming change. News was open, public,
without distinction of persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the claims of local life were so exacting and so
overpowering we can scarcely wonder if the burgher
took little thought for matters that lay beyond his
“parish.” But within the narrow limits of the town
dominions his experience was rich and varied. While
townsmen were forced at every turn to discover and
justify the limits of their privileges, or while controversies
raged among them as to how the government
of the community should be carried on, there
was no lack of political teaching; and all questions
“touching the great commonalty of the city” for
whose liberties they had fought and whose constitution
they had shaped, stirred loyal citizens to a genuine
patriotism. Traders too, intent on the developement
of their business, were deeply concerned in all the
questions that affected commerce, the securing of communications,
or the opening of new roads for trade, or
the organization of labour. In such matters activity
could never sleep; for the towns anticipated modern
nations in the faith that the advantage of one community
must be the detriment of another, and competition
and commercial jealousy ran high.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
perhaps in English history was local feeling so strong.
Public virtue was summed up in an ardent municipal
zeal, as lively among the “Imperial Co-citizens” of
New Sarum<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> as among the “Great Clothing” of bigger
boroughs. In those days indeed busy provincials but
dimly conscious of national policy found in the confusion
of court politics and the distraction of its intrigues,
or in the feuds of a divided and bewildered
administration, no true call to national service and no
popular leader to quicken their sympathies. Civil
wars which swept over the country at the bidding
of a factious group of nobles or of a vain and unscrupulous
Kingmaker left, and justly left, the towns
supremely indifferent to any question save that of how
to make the best terms for themselves from the winning
side, or to use the disasters of warring lords so
as to extend their own privileges.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Meanwhile in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
intense effort called out by the new industrial and
commercial conditions and the reorganization of
social life which they demanded, it was inevitable
that there should grow up in the boroughs the
temper of men absorbed in a critical struggle for ends
which however important were still personal, local,
limited, purely material&mdash;a temper inspired by private
interest and with its essential narrowness untouched
by the finer conceptions through which a great
patriotism is nourished. Such a temper, if it brought
at first great rewards, brought its own penalties at last,
when the towns, self-dependent, unused to confederation
for public purposes, destitute of the generous
spirit of national regard, and by their ignorance and
narrow outlook left helpless in presence of the revolutions
that were to usher in the modern world, saw the
government of their trade and the ordering of their
constitutions taken from them, and their councils
degraded by the later royal despotism into the
instruments and support of tyranny.</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">NOTE A.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">There are many instances of the responsibility of individual
citizens for costs of various kinds which were the charge of the
whole borough. In 1212 the townsmen of Southampton got hold
of the King’s money that came from Ireland, and two bailiffs and six
principal men were charged with its payment to the King. (Madox
Firma Burgi, 158.) A bailiff of Chichester was fined in 1395 for
not attending at a session of the peace, and as he had no lands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
chattels to seize for the debt, two citizens were charged with the
payment of the fine. (Ibid. 187.) In 1256, when Warwick had
to pay a fine of forty marks to the King for a trespass, the sheriff
was ordered to raise the fine both from the townsmen and from
all men of the suburb, both within and without the liberty, who
did merchandise in the city of Warwick. (Ibid. 183.) In 1431
the bailiffs of Andover were held responsible for various escapes
from prison. They were declared insolvent and the charge
thrown back upon the town. The townsmen, however, pleaded
that two of the officers charged had quite enough goods and
chattels either in the town or in the country to pay themselves,
and as for the third they had never chosen him. (Madox, 210.
Other instances, ibid. 182, 184, &amp;c.; Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 173.)
In 1456 the Mayor and Common Council of Leicester agreed that
all actions brought against them in the King’s Court by the
bailiff should be paid for by the whole town. (Hist. MSS. Com.
viii. 422.)</p>

<p>This method of raising money was never a popular proceeding,
and in almost every case where there is an account of goods
seized from a community or guild for the payment of ferm or
fine, the sheriffs seem to make the return that these goods remain
on their hands for want of buyers. (Madox, 188, 212, 214, 217,
218.) It is evident that the responsibility of the private citizens
was almost extinguished in later times (see Madox, 217), at least
in some cases&mdash;a fact which may be referred to “the mayor and
burgesses” replacing for official purposes “the community,” and
being licensed to hold <i>corporate</i> property.</p>

<p>It is necessary to distinguish between the responsibility for
the <i>borough</i> expenses and the responsibility for the <i>trading</i> debts
of the burghers. In the latter case the “community” was also
responsible, but the guarantee was strictly confined to burghers
and not shared by inhabitants. For the inconvenience to which
burghers were subject by being seized for debts whereof they were
neither debtors nor pledges, see Derby. (Rep. on Markets, 58.)
Mr. Maitland points out that the doctrine that traders form a
society in which each member is answerable for the faults of the
others, which is shown in early charters, was gradually wearing
out, and in 1275 a law was passed that no Englishman could
be distrained for any debt unless he was himself the debtor or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the pledge, though possibly this law still left members of a
community in the position of pledges. But long before this
law was passed all the bigger towns had already obtained
charters to the same effect. See the charter of Norwich in
1255. “We have granted, and by this our Charter confirmed, to
our beloved citizens of Norwich, that they and their heirs for
ever shall have this liberty through all our land and power, viz.
that they or their goods found in whatever places in our power
shall not be arrested for any debt of which they shall not be
sureties or principal debtors.” (Stanley <i>v.</i> Mayor, Norwich Doc.
1884, 7.) In 1256 goods belonging to the Norwich freemen were
arrested for the debts of others that were not free at Boston
fair. Norwich however produced its charter of the year before,
making their goods free from arrest for any debt unless they
were the principal debtors, <i>or the debtors were of their society</i>.
(Blomefield, iii. 50, 51.)</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland (Select Pleas in Manorial Courts, Selden Society,
ii. 134-5) in discussing this question of the trading guarantee
points out the difference between the responsibility of the “communitas”
and of the “cives” or “burgesses” of a town, showing
that the “communitas” did not form a juristic person, while
“the citizens” of a town could sue and be sued collectively by a
common name. He thinks that the “communitas” may mean
the merchant guild “though not perhaps in all cases a duly
chartered guild.” Of this there is no proof, and many serious
difficulties lie in the way of accepting the hypothesis. In the
case of Leicester, where there was a merchant guild, it is never
mentioned, the responsibility lies on the “members of the community
of Leicester,” (p. 145-7) and Thomas pleads, not that he
was not in the merchant guild, but that he was from Coventry.
So also “the whole community of Norwich” is spoken of in exactly
the same way, but in Norwich there was <i>no</i> guild merchant,
(p. 149, 152. See also on this point Hudson’s Mun. Org. 36.
Notes on Norwich in the Norfolk Archæology, xii. “The city and
feudalism.”) In Nottingham, John Beeston (p. 153-4) brings a
counter-charge against the community of Stamford, (p. 159); he
was probably one of the very numerous licensed traders of Nottingham
and not a burgher. (Nott. Rec. ii. 102-4, 240-4; iii. 349-52.)
It is important to notice the words of the charter by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in 1255 the Nottingham burghers had obtained freedom from
arrest, “except in case the debtors are of their commune and power,
having whereof their debts may be wholly or partly satisfied,
and the said burgesses shall have failed in doing justice to the
creditors of the same debtors.” (Nott. Rec. i. 41.) For Wiggenhall,
(Select Pleas, pp. 157-8.) The mutual responsibility must be considered
in connection with the inter-municipal treaties (see Vol.
ii. ch. iii.) which were always drawn up in the name of “the
community” at this early time, and never at <i>any</i> time in the name
of the guild merchant. I have suggested in vol. ii. (see Norwich,
Lynn, Nottingham, Southampton) another meaning of “communitas,”
which seems to me to apply also to the instances here
mentioned by Mr. Maitland.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWNSPEOPLE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> dispute has raged more fiercely in this century,
not only in England but throughout Europe, than
the dispute as to what qualifications should make a
man fit to take part in the government of his state.
The possession of property in land, a fixed yearly
income, birth into a certain rank, a standard of age,
some degree of education&mdash;these and other tests of
merit have been applied in the hope of securing
that every active citizen shall be distinguished by
a fitting capacity, whether proved by his own attainments
or guaranteed by the virtues or the prosperity
of his ancestors. But the anxieties and cares of
great states in this matter are only the repetition on a
grand scale of the perplexities that beset the humble
communities who first tried to solve the problem of
how a society of freemen could best rule themselves.
In the early “communitas” of the village or town
out of which the later chartered borough was to grow&mdash;a
community which possessed common fields or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
customary rights of common over surrounding
meadows, and which had doubtless found some
regular system for the management of its own affairs<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>&mdash;the
obvious course was to count as the responsible
men of the township the land-holders who had a
share in the common property; and when the community
had received the charter which made it
into a free borough the same system was naturally
continued. Those who owned a house and a certain
amount of land, measured according to the custom
of the borough, formed the society of burghers,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to the townspeople, as to Swift centuries later, the
definition of law was “the will of the majority
of those who have the property in land.” Equality
of possessions brought with it equality of civil
rights, and each community formed a homogeneous
body whose members were all subject to the
same conditions and shared in the same interests.
When the burgher’s life was over, the son who
inherited his property appeared before the bailiffs
within forty days, to deliver up to them his father’s
sword and take the freeman’s oath;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and the common
life went on undisturbed by the intrusion of any
foreign element, vagrant, restless, encroaching.</p>

<p>But such simple conditions of life, only possible in
a stationary agricultural society,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> disappeared when
industry and commerce brought their revelation of
new standards of prosperity. In the course of a
very few generations there was scarcely a trace left
of that primitive relation of equality out of which
the early equality of rights had sprung. As the
country folk migrated in increasing numbers from
manor and village to the town<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> old rigid distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
were swept away, and the simplicity and uniformity
of the burgage tenure was completely broken up. In
Liverpool, for example, the burgages originally established
by John were already in the fourteenth
century divided into small fractions one-eighth or
even one-forty-eighth part of their original size;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
and the amount of land held by owners of property
in Nottingham in the fifteenth century varied so
much that the taxes levied on them were in some
cases as high as £3 14<i>s.</i> 7½<i>d.</i>, in other cases as low
as a farthing.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The owners of capital began to
thrust out the owners of land; the shopkeeper
replaced the agriculturist, the tradesman and the
artizan exercised a new power, as the boroughs
quickly adapted themselves to the changing conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the time and opened one door after another for the
bringing in of new members whose wealth or whose
skill might benefit the community. The ownership of
land still carried with it its ancient rights.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> But the
son of a freeman who himself owned no land might
be made a burgher in his father’s lifetime. Aliens
might buy the franchise. Craftsmen were admitted
into the circle of the citizens.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Recruits from every
class and from every nation pressed into the ranks of
burgesses. There were foreigners from Bordeaux or
from Flanders or from Lisbon,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and Irishmen in
abundance, in spite of occasional outbursts of
hostility in which Irish burghers were deprived of
their freedom, “till they bought it again with the
blood of their purses, and with weeping eyes, kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on their knees, besought the mayor and his
brethren of their grace.”<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> No limit was set, whether
of race, or occupation, or descent, or wealth, if they
“are born in the city and be of good report, and if
their presence may be profitable to the city as well
as for his wisdom, as also for any other validity or worth
known to the citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The new society took in alike
traders, agriculturists, bondmen looking for freedom,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
parish priests,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> merchants who owned eight or
ten ships and employed over a hundred workmen;
small masters with but a single journeyman
or perhaps two; artizans just released from apprenticeship
and enrolled as members of some craft gild;
rich folk who held several burgages, and men who
rented a tiny shop. Everywhere the town communities
were fast outgrowing the old simple traditions of
common acquaintance and friendship, and throughout
the fifteenth century the seals of the frequent new
comers were so unfamiliar to their fellow citizens that
deeds of sale had constantly to be brought to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Mayor for the addition of his seal of office to overcome
hesitation and distrust.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>The hospitality of the corporations differed from
place to place. Sometimes a borough threw its gates
wide open and welcomed any new comer who would
but choose one of the half-dozen avenues to citizenship
that lay before him,&mdash;who would buy land, or
marry a free woman, or pay the fixed price for his
freedom, or serve his apprenticeship to a trade, or
accept the franchise as a gift from the community;
while a neighbouring town, looking on aliens with
jealousy and hesitation, would close its doors and
cling to some narrower system of enfranchisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
which kept its ranks pure from foreign blood, and
its burghers free from anxieties of competition.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Each
community in fact had full liberty to order its own
political experiment. In the matter of choosing
their fellow burgesses, of framing their own society
and fixing the limits of its growth, the citizens knew
no law and recognized no authority beyond their
own,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and enjoyed herein a measure of independence
unknown in continental countries where a powerful
feudal system still barred every road to freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>When a new comer who desired to be “franchised
for a free man, ... and fellow in your rolls”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
was accepted by the commonalty he was summoned
before them in a public court, “having with them
the common charter of the city; and then the
steward shall take the book, and bid them lay their
right hands thereon, commanding all those that are
standing by, in the behalf of our Lord the King, to
keep silence,” and the oath of obedience to the
King and fidelity to the customs of the town was
administered,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>&mdash;perhaps, as at Winchester, the
“oath to swear men to be free, kneeling on their
knees.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The candidate had further to find two or
more good men as pledges that he would “observe
all the laws;”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and to pay the customary fees,
which varied with the caution or the poverty of the
borough from three shillings to five pounds; while
a poor corporation like Wells was content to receive
its payments in wine or gloves or wax when money
was scarce.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The new burgess was then required to give security
to the town for payment of taxes or any other
municipal claims by proving that he had either a
good yearly revenue or a tenement, or by at once
building himself a house.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> A wooden framework was
put together either on some building ground or
perhaps in a vacant space in the open street,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and
was then carried to the new site. The interstices
were quickly filled up with plaster, and the little
tenement was complete. A couple of rough benches
and one or two pots and a few tools served as
furniture, and the new burgess entered into possession
and began life as a citizen householder.
Henceforth he was bound to live within the walls of
the borough, for his franchise was forfeited if he
forsook the town for a year and a day.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Over the
house, which was the town’s security for rent and
taxes, the municipality kept a watchful eye: if it
became ruinous and dangerous to the passer-by it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was thrown down at the owner’s cost, or if needful
at the cost of the commonalty; if through neglect
or poverty it fell into decay the next heir and the
commonalty together could compel him to put it
in order or give it up.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Once or twice a year the
burgher had to appear at the Portmote or Borough
Court to prove his presence in the town, and to take
his necessary part in the duties of the court.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> An
unwavering loyalty and public spirit was demanded
of him, and the loss of “frelidge,” as they said in
Carlisle, avenged any breach of public duty, such as
a refusal to help the Mayor in keeping the peace,
clamour and undue disturbance at the election of
town officers, revealing the counsels of the Common
Assembly, resistance in word or deed to the municipal
officers, contempt of the Mayor’s authority, or
any offence for which the punishment of the pillory
or the tumbrill was adjudged.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> For such things
the burgher was “blotted out of the book of the
bailiff”; and the forfeiture of his freedom was declared
by open proclamation of the common crier, or by sound
of the town bell, or by having his name written up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
on a Disfranchised Table in the Guild Hall,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> so that all
the town should know his shame. In Preston those
who betrayed the municipal confidence or exposed the
poverty of the town were not only deprived of the
franchise, but their toll was taken every day as of
forsworn and unworthy persons who could not be
trusted beyond the passing hour.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>It was no mean advantage to be a burgher in those
days, when nearly all material benefits and legal aids
and political rights were reserved for the favoured
classes, and when it was the towns that opened for
the working man and the shopkeeper a way to take
their place too among the people of privilege. The
burghers, of course, shared alike in rights of common
and of pasturage on the town lands, of fishing in the
town waters,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> of the ferry across the stream or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sea channel, and so forth; but their pre-eminent
privilege was the right to trade. If ordinary inhabitants
were allowed to buy and sell food or
the bare necessaries of life, all profitable business
was reserved as the monopoly of the full citizen.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
Protected from the intrusion and the competition
of the alien,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> he paid a reduced toll for his merchandize
at the entrance of the town; his stall in
the market was rented at a lower price than that
of the stranger; he had the first choice of storage
room in the Guild Hall for his wool or leather
or corn; the town clock which tolled the hour
when the market might begin, struck for the burgher
an hour or two earlier than for strangers and
visitors.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> If a travelling merchant brought his wares
to the town the citizen might claim the right of buying
whether the owner wished to sell or no, and
might insist on a share in the profits of any mercantile
venture.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> He alone might keep apprentices, and
become a master in his craft. If he travelled outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
his own town for the purpose of trade he carried
privilege with him everywhere, and confidently claimed
freedom from “pontage” and “passage” and “pesage”
and “shewage,”&mdash;that is from tolls for crossing
bridges, for passing into a town, for the weighing of
goods, for showing merchandize in the market,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>&mdash;and
from a host of similar imposts. Wherever he
went he was shielded by the protection of his fellow
citizens;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> if he had an action for debt in any other
town he was granted common letters from the
Mayor and Jurats to assist him in his suit;<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> if any
wrong was done him they enforced compensation,
or they avenged his injuries by confiscating the
goods of any merchants within their walls who had
come from the offending town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Legal safeguards and privileges moreover fenced
him about on every side. He could only be impleaded
in the courts of his own town, and any fellow citizen
who brought an action against him outside the
borough might be disgraced and disfranchised;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> while
the King himself could not summon a burgher to appear
before his judges at Westminster, save on the
plea that there had been “lack of justice” at the first
trial in the court of his own town. No “foreigner”
might meddle in any legal inquiry in which their
houses and property were concerned;<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> while, on the
other hand, every citizen from twelve years old could
serve on juries for the town business.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Peculiar
favours were extended to the burgher,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> as at
Worcester where there were special provisions to
protect him from any wrongful fine by the bailiff,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and the city sergeant had to do any legal business
required of him at reduced fees; or at Canterbury,
where special formalities of trial assured to him
a more exact and careful justice; or at Sandwich,
where he could be tried only before the mayor, and
could not be summoned before his deputy like a
common stranger.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Everywhere he could claim the
right of being separated from the common criminals
and imprisoned in some tower or room in the Guild
Hall used as the Freeman’s prison.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>But all these privileges were far from being a free
gift to be enjoyed in idle security; and to each individual
burgher the franchise practically meant a
sort of carefully-adjusted bargain, by which he compounded
for paying certain tolls by undertaking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
do work, and work which might be both costly and
laborious, for the community. The body of citizens
was but a small one, and every man in it was liable
at some time or other to be called on to take his part
in the public service. Taxation for the town expenses,
watch and ward, service on juries, the call to arms in
defence of the borough, were incidents as familiar as
unwelcome in every burgher’s life; but a more
serious matter was the summons to take office and
serve as mayor or bailiff or town clerk or sergeant
or tax-collector or common constable&mdash;offices not
always coveted in those days, when the mayor was
held personally responsible for the rent of a town
which was perhaps vexed with pestilence or wasted
with fire; when treasurers had to find funds as best
they could for too frequent official bribes or state
receptions of great lords or court officers; when
bailiffs had to meet the loss from failing dues and
straitened markets;<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> when the boxes of the tax-collector
were left half empty through poverty, or riots,
or disputed questions of market-rights;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and when
the constable was “frayed” day and night by sturdy
men, dagger in hand, ready to break the King’s peace.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
Many modes of escape were tried. The inhabitants
would refuse to take up the franchise, or they would
leave the town for a time;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> an elected officer would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
plead a vow of pilgrimage to “S. James in Gallice;”
or an influential burgess might obtain letters patent
from the King which granted him freedom from
serving any municipal office during his life.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> But
generally a heavy fine compelled the submission of a
refractory citizen, and in the last resort the community
would apply for a writ against him from the
Privy Council.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The town allowed no excuses, and
everywhere the citizens were forced by stringent
laws to take on them the offices to which they had
been elected by their fellows. In Lydd an order was
made in 1429 that any one who had been appointed
by the bailiff or jurats to take any journey on town
business should pay a fine if he refused without
reasonable cause.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In the Cinque Ports generally if
a citizen who had been elected as mayor or jurat declined
to serve, his house was pulled down;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> or as at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Romney the bailiff with the whole community went
to his dwelling, turned himself, his wife, his children,
and all his household into the street, shut the
windows and sealed the door, and so left matters
until “he wished to set himself right by doing the
said duty of jurat.” In Sandwich again, “if a person
when elected treasurer will not take upon him the
office he shall not be permitted to bake or brew, or
if he does bake or brew the commons may take his
bread and beer to their own use till he accepts the
office.”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> At the worst, however, the burgher might
thankfully remember that his public duty practically
ceased at the wall and moat that bounded the town,
and that when he had paid down his money towards
the buying of the town charter he was at least safe from
the danger of being sent as tax-collector or constable
or juror anywhere throughout the country round.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>The privileges and duties of the free citizen remained,
however, the endowment of the few. That
larger conception of the common rights of man which
had begun to make its way in the boroughs, was
checked and hindered at every turn by the complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
conditions of town life, by the jealousy of established
settlers as to new comers, the exclusive temper
which the crafts had begun to show, the terror of
the trader before free competition, the imperfectly
developed authority of the corporations over the space
within the town walls, where it had failed to break the
barriers of feudal custom and the claims of ecclesiastical
corporations. Howsoever the towns widened their borders,
there was still a growing population which lingered
just outside the circle of free citizens, shut out by one
cause or another from full municipal liberty. Settlers
came who did not care to burden themselves with
the duties and charges of citizenship; there were
dwellers in churchyards and tenants of ecclesiastical
estates, who carried on their business within the town
liberties but remained without the town jurisdiction;
landowners from outside the walls brought their corn
and wool to the town market; traders came from time
to time with wares to sell; there were apprentices
and journeymen, escaped bondmen, and country-folk
coming to look for work. As all of these alike needed
the protection of the town, so the town needed their
services; and by degrees their respective duties and
rights were laid down in charters, in ordinances, or in
friendly compacts.</p>

<p>I. Thus it came about that below the ranks of the
burgesses, themselves secure in their municipal supremacy,
were ranged orders of men more or less
highly favoured according to their degree. First
came the inhabitants who had paid for special rights
of trade in the town, or were admitted as members
of the Merchant Guild. In times of commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
prosperity when wandering dealers and artizans
were attracted to some thriving borough for trading
purposes they went to swell this class of independent
inhabitants, subject to the jurisdiction of the town
courts, but taking no part in its politics;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> so that
it occasionally happened, as in Norwich and Worcester,
that the town refused to harbour this body
of irresponsible inhabitants and passed a law ordering
them to become citizens.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> When on the other
hand trade declined and poverty settled down on
the town, as in Romney and Winchester, the failing
fortunes of the people were marked by a steady
decrease of the class of “advocantes,” or those who
would “avow” themselves freemen, and inhabitants
who in their distress refused or renounced the
franchise,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> were driven into the ranks of the politically
unfree.</p>

<p>II. So long as the trading inhabitants owned the
jurisdiction of the town courts their presence brought
no serious difficulty to the ruling authorities. But
within the town walls there were other groups
of men who lay beyond this jurisdiction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
held an ambiguous position which was the source of
many a quarrel for ascendency and many a struggle
for license in the course of the fifteenth century.
These were the tenants and dependants of bishop or
abbot, of some lay lord, or of the king’s castle&mdash;men
who lived within the liberties of the borough and who
had the right of trading in the town, but who were
bound to do suit and service at the courts of
their own special lord.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> To some extent they
were forced to recognize the mayor’s authority, since
their rights of trade were guaranteed by his protection,
and since he yearly reminded them of his
power to levy taxes on all property within the liberties
of the borough. But their obedience was grudging
and their loyalty was cold. The mayor could not awe
them by a summons to his court, or enforce his demands
with threat of pains and penalties; he could
scarcely terrify them into submission with his sergeant
and a few constables. By degrees, it is true,
the tenants of the king’s castle or of feudal lords
became merged in the general body of the inhabitants.
But the tenants of ecclesiastical estates<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> were maintained
by lords who were bound by every tradition
of their order never to yield up the least jot of
authority to the secular power, and least of all to the
secular power as represented by groups of upstart
drapers and fishmongers and weavers whose humble
shops and booths leaned against the walls of the
abbey or the priory, and whose pretensions, loud
and noisy though they might be, were perhaps a
century or so old at the best. The ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
tenants therefore remained everywhere an alien
body, no true partakers in the life of the town,
and when supported by a powerful bishop or abbot
determined to crush the pretensions of a struggling
borough they proved a serious danger to municipal
unity, and one which the authorities found themselves
powerless to conquer till the Reformation
settled the question for ever.</p>

<p>III. There was another class of privileged traders,&mdash;those
who lived altogether outside the town,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
who knew nothing of its courts, and bore none of
its charges. We find everywhere these country
traders under various styles and with various privileges
according to the town’s discretion and convenience.
Sometimes the citizens sold rights of
trade to cultivators of the surrounding lands and
occasional visitors to fair or market, and nobles
and landowners were ready to give large yearly
payments for freedom of the market and for the
right of having granaries in the town. Peasants
who owned a plot of land just outside the borough
increased their scanty store by learning some little
handicraft or doing a small trade in the town; or
craftsmen settled down beyond the boundaries to
escape the town dues and live more cheaply. At
first the settlement of workmen and traders at their
gates may have seemed a matter of small consequence,
but as time went on the danger which was
hidden in these communities of free-traders became
apparent. The manufacturer or dealer was able by
one device or another to protect himself against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the enterprising man of the suburbs who came in
with his cheaper goods; it was the journeymen of
the towns who failed before the stress of the battle,
driven back from their poor entrenchments by the
masses who pushed forward on all sides to contest
with them admission into the lower ranks of industry
where the scantiest skill sufficed to earn a bare
subsistence.</p>

<p>IV. Last of all came the non-burgesses, who had
neither any share in the government, nor any rights
to rent a stall in the market, nor to own shop or
workroom in the town. These formed an obscure
company of workers without records or history.
They counted among their number ancient burghers
who had fallen into low estate and could no longer pay
their burgage dues, as well as the poor who had never
prospered so far as to buy a tenure or citizenship.
But they were not all necessarily poor or miserable.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
Rich merchants came from foreign parts to settle for
four or eight months at a time, as the law might allow
them, and bought and sold within the four walls of
the room which the Town Council had ordered in
some inn as their dwelling-place, with the host standing
at their elbow to witness every bargain. Foreign
workmen sometimes came to settle, like the Flemish
weavers in Bristol, or the Dutch makers of canals
and sluices whom we find in the towns of the
southern coast. Companies of tilers or builders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
gathered in towns where stone houses were becoming
the fashion, or where the Council had issued an order
that within the next few months every house must
provide itself with roof and chimney of brick or
tiles.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The seaports had their uncertain element of
sailors, “shipmen that had nought, and cared never
an they were once on the sea whether they come
again or not,” and who at Yarmouth formed a riotous
population, so that it was said that “no thrifty man
would live in it.”<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Labourers from the country came
in to win freedom from serfage. Others came to
look for higher wages, and the hope which town
life held out to the enterprising and the ambitious;
so that in 1405 an Act of Parliament declared
that the fields were deserted, and the “gentlemen
and other people of the nation greatly impoverished”
by the labourers seeking apprenticeship in towns,
“and that for the pride of clothing and other evil
customs that servants do use in the same.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Children
came, constantly as young as seven, never
older than twelve&mdash;when they were expected to
begin the work of life just as at that age their
brothers of a better station took on themselves
the duties of citizenship, for “every poor man
that hath brought up children to the age of twelve
year waiteth then to be holp and profited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
his children.”<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Thenceforward they had to fight
their own way, looking for assistance not to their
fathers but to their patrons, “whence it proceeds
that, having no hope of their paternal inheritance,
they all become so greedy of gain that they feel no
shame in asking almost ‘for the love of God,’ for
the smallest sums of money; and to this it may be
attributed that there is no injury that can be committed
against the lower orders of the English that
may not be atoned for by money.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>But if apprenticeship ever brought with it “pride
of clothing,” the poor working class of the towns
fared roughly and worked hard among artizans who
“hold full hungry house,” who know “long labour
and light winning,” who taste no wine from week
to week, whose bed has no blanket, and on
whose board no white bread ever comes.”<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Once
this rough living and rougher toil had been a sure
way of entering into the privileges of municipal
freedom. But even in the fourteenth century this
was no longer the case. The poorer burghers opposed
the admission of new comers to share their
common lands, and insisted on selling the franchise
dearly. The crafts had already begun to form
themselves into close companies, and by prohibitive
fines shut out all save the descendants of their own
members; while at the same time the custom was
growing up that the town franchise should be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
only to those who were enrolled in a craft or trade
guild; and strangers therefore found the way barred
against them; they could neither become masters in
their craft nor burgesses in their town, and went to
swell the general mass of journeymen and serving
men. Moreover the Peasant Revolt had carried with
it widespread terror, and from that time some towns,
as for instance York and Bridgenorth, refused to
allow any born bondman, whatever his estate, to
receive the freedom of the city. Thus from one
cause or another groups of men were formed in the
midst of every town who were shut out from the
civic life of the community, and whose natural bond
of union was hostility to the privileged class which
denied them the dignity of free citizens and refused
them fair competition in trading enterprise. The
burghers yearly added to their number half a dozen
or perhaps even a score of members wealthy enough
to buy the privilege, while the increase in the
unenfranchised class, which had begun very early in
the town life, proceeded by leaps and bounds; till
presently the old balance of forces in the little state
was overthrown, the ancient constitution of a free
community of equal householders was altogether
annulled and forgotten, and a comparatively small
class of privileged citizens ruled with a strong hand
over subject traders and labourers to whom they
granted neither the forms nor the substance of
liberty.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENT</p>

<p class="pch"><i>Bridport</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> comfortable independence in which the townspeople
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had
stoutly entrenched themselves, was the reward
of a couple of centuries of persistent effort, in
which they had steadily laboured at their double
work of emancipation, freeing themselves on the one
hand from the feudal yoke, and on the other from
political servitude. No independent life of the
community could arise so long as the inhabitants of
a town acknowledged an absolute subjection to their
feudal lord, and bore the heavy burdens of services
and taxes which, however they might differ
according to the usages of the several manors,
weighed upon the people everywhere with persistent
and intolerable force. The lord might destroy their
industry by suddenly calling out the inhabitants to
follow him in a warlike expedition, or demanding
services of forced labour or laying on them grievous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
taxes; his officers could throw the artizan or merchant
into his prison, or ruin them by fines, or force upon
them methods of law hateful and dangerous to their
conceptions of a common life; as he claimed supreme
rights over the soil it was impossible for the burgher
to leave his property by will; and on the tenant’s
death officers visited his house and stables and
granaries to seize the most valuable goods as the
lord’s relief. It was necessary to gain his consent
before any new member could be admitted into the
fellowship of citizens; and without his permission no
inhabitant might leave the borough to carry on his
trade elsewhere. He could forbid the marriage of
children arranged by the fathers, or refuse to
allow a widow to take a new husband and so make
him master of her house and freeman in her town.
He fixed the market laws and the market tolls.
He forced the people to grind at his mill and bake
at his oven.</p>

<p>If therefore the burghers were ever to develope
commerce, or gather wealth, or form an organized
society, or keep order in their streets, it was before
all things necessary that serfs should be made into
freemen; and the first object of the town communities
was to find deliverance by purchase or
negociation from those tyrannous usages by which
their masters pressed most heavily on them. Vexatious
feudal obligations were commuted for fixed payments
in one town after another as their inhabitants
grew rich and independent. A bargain was made,
for instance, with the lord of Preston that he should
no longer summon any burgess to follow him on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
warlike expedition which lasted more than one day
nor imprison on any accusation whatever a townsman
who found sureties; and he was forced to sell or
renounce the right of compelling the people to carry
their corn to the lord’s mill or oven or kiln, and
to allow any householder who chose to build an oven
on his own ground.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The burgher everywhere became
the acknowledged guardian of his own children
and might betroth them at his pleasure; the
right of widows to re-marry was secured against
any interference from without; and absolute security
was given to every citizen that under no circumstances
could his tenement or plot of ground be
claimed by any superior lord.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> When the burgesses
of Hereford were asked by a neighbouring
town to give an account of their constitution
they proudly dwelt upon the freedom they had
won. “We do not use,” they say, “to do fealty or
any other foreign service to the lord of the fees
for our tenements, but only the rents arising out
of the said tenements; because we say that we hold
our tenements by the service of burgage, or as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
burgesses, so that we have not any other lord between
our lord the king and us.” “And we do not so
use,” they add, “to give any heriot nor mortuary
to any one at the death of any of the citizens
dying within the said city or suburbs, for any
of his tenements.” Moreover “we say that every
citizen of the city or suburbs may give and assign their
tenements freely and quietly as well in health as in
sickness, when and to whomsoever they please,
whether those tenements are of their inheritance or of
their purchasing or getting, without any malicious
detracting of their lord, so that they be of such an
age and no less, that they know how to measure a
yard of cloth, and to know and tell twelve pence.”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>In these ways and in many others by which personal
freedom was checked and thwarted, the rights of the
feudal lord were irresistibly swept away by the
pressure of growing societies of active traders and
artizans.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> But the need for political emancipation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
no less urgent; and here the way to liberty was
neither simple nor easy. A very hierarchy of powers
held the path. The authority which the lord of the
manor did not assume was exercised by the sheriff of
the county; and where the authority of the sheriff
ceased the supreme right of the king began. All
government and jurisdiction were divided among
powers in high places; and whatever privileges the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
burghers might secure must be won here a little
and there a little, bought for money, or snatched
amid the distresses and calamities of their masters, or
held as the reward of importunate persistence, the
tribute to successful craft, the recompense of some
timely service rendered.</p>

<p>The case of Bridport illustrates the life of any
provincial town in early times whose burghers still
served many masters.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> It was a busy little trading
community in the thirteenth century. Hemp was
grown in its fields which was sent to Plympton to
be made into rope yarn, returned to Bridport to be
woven into ropes, and then sent back again to
Plympton for sale, or fashioned at home into the
girths, horse-nets, and reins for which the Bridport
men were famous. The inhabitants had won a considerable
measure of self-rule. They elected the two
bailiffs who were at the head of their local government,
presided in the little town court, and doubtless
regulated the market and controlled the trade.
These two had under them under-bailiffs, cofferers,
and constables; and were assisted by twelve jurors
chosen every Michaelmas, who yearly perambulated
the town to watch over its boundaries, and who
had charge of the “parish cheste” or coffin and
the parish bier, and of the pillory, whipping post,
and cucking stool. Twelve men were also chosen to
conduct any business in which Bridport was concerned.
At the visits of the king’s justices they were summoned
with the clerk in council to assist in the
business of the court; they represented their fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
burgesses if any question was called for trial before
the sheriffs court at Dorchester, or if a dispute
arose with the bishop, or a settlement had to be
made with the convent at Abbotsbury.</p>

<p>I. The powers of the burgesses however were shut
up within the narrowest limits. At every moment of
their lives some authority from without stepped in with
rigorous control and ceaseless exactions. The Lord of
the Manor (who in this particular case was the king)
owned the soil of the town; therefore his Steward
kept the Law Day,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> judged the petty offences of the
townsmen, summoned them before him to see that
each was properly enrolled under the system of frankpledge,
and swept their fines and forfeitures into the
lord’s coffers.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>II. Bridport further owed obedience to the officers
of the shire. The coroner<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> came to make inquisition in
case of mysterious or violent death or of fire, judged
the cause, seized forfeited goods or chattels, and
assessed the fines. The sheriff of the county exercised
a jurisdiction which extended over the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
important affairs of the community, and touched at
every point the daily life of the burghers. That his
supervision might be constant and effectual, he was
accustomed to appoint a deputy or under-sheriff to
represent him on the spot, generally some man of
importance in Bridport itself, who living in the
centre of the town could keep a close watch on its
affairs and manage them with a more exact control.
It was the sheriff’s business to keep order, and guard
against breaches of the king’s law. At stated times
he called the town bailiff and constable to appear
at his court at Dorchester; crimes which lay beyond
the control of the manor court were brought to
judgment before him and fines, or the gifts that
averted fines,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> reminded the burghers of his power.
As head of the shire forces he ordered at his own
will the muster-at-arms of the townsmen, and in
times of disturbance called out the levies for the
king’s service; he fixed the number of archers and
fighting men; he regulated the contribution of
bows and arrows, of hemp and cord, of corn or wine
or fish. Year by year he assessed and levied the
royal taxes,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> and collected the rent due from the
borough to the king’s exchequer. Payments were
not made in money in such a town as Bridport; so
when the rent day came near the sheriff or his deputy
first drew up a list of oxen and other goods which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
were to be given up by the various inhabitants and ultimately
sold on the Monday after Palm Sunday for
the ferm. Meanwhile this list was handed over to the
charge of the “bailiff-errant,” who travelled from
town to town with his clerk and groom<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> on the
business of the shire; and certain citizens were made
responsible for the safety of the cattle and goods
until the appointed day. The choice of goods to be
taken from each person, the chance of accident
before the day of sale, the naming of citizens who
were to bear the charges of making good any possible
loss, the various fortunes of the auction and
of the prices it might bring, the skilful calculations
necessary to ensure that however much the profits
might exceed the needed sum they should never fall
short of it&mdash;all these things created at every turn new
chances of corruption, new hopes of profit to those in
authority, and new prospects of ruin to those under
the law.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The division of powers between the sheriff
and his deputies, and the practical impossibility of
fixing any responsibility or of calling any one of
them to account, left the inhabitants mere creatures
at mercy, subject to varied and fortuitous hardship;
while on the other hand the art of government
became to every one concerned in it a mere business
of self-preservation. When John in 1216 sent a commission
to collect the ferm of Northampton which had
fallen into arrears, the commissioner was informed
that the king could not afford payment either for
himself or for his servants, and that he must therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
provide as best he could for their salaries and
provisions out of the arrears of the ferm which he
was sent to collect.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Such a system quickened zeal
on the part of officials, if it did not lighten the
troubles of the people. In those days every officer in
the scale, from the sheriff to the constable, subject to
the claims and exactions of his immediate superior,
could only indemnify himself by exercising a corresponding
pressure on those below him, and passing on
the tradition of fraud and tyranny.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say whether the sheriff’s position
as tax-gatherer, as judge, or as recruiting officer and
military leader, gave him the largest opportunities for
extortion and tyranny; but so long as every office
that he held added new pretences for arbitrary
interference, the townspeople were driven to win
his favour by frequent gifts, whether to himself
or to his wife, which indeed his deputies were strict
in levying when voluntary action proved tardy. He
generally required a “year gift” from towns under
his control, either to induce him not to come within
their liberties, or to remind him to “shew his
friendship” to the inhabitants in their necessities;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
and it was a common custom, when money fell
short, to make collection by means of a “scot-ale,”<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
and summon the townsfolk to a drinking feast where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
they were bound to contribute a supply of provisions,
and to spend a certain sum at the ale-booths
set up for the day, while the proceeds of the whole
entertainment went into the sheriff’s pocket. Modes
of extortion, however, might vary infinitely. In
Canterbury the sheriff once broke down the only
bridge over the river, and so kept it for three months,
while he put a ferry boat on the water which the
people were forced to use and pay for on his own terms.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
The confessed superiority of these officials in the arts
of fraud and tyranny was proclaimed by the universal
fear and hate which followed them&mdash;passions which
break out in the popular ballads where by a traditional
touch the people’s hero, Robin Hood, is endowed with
the hatred of all sheriffs; and which stir the heart of
the writer of Piers Ploughman as he pictures these
officers in the foremost place wherever there is a
gathering of the servants of corruption, and in his
parable of the Lady Meed travelling to the Court
tells how it was a sheriff who was appointed to bear
her softly in a litter from Assize to Assize with
tenderest care for her safety, since “sheriffs of shires
were shent (undone) if she were not.”<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>III. The sheriff however was but the deputy of the
crown, and the sovereign rights of the King lay behind
and above all subordinate authority whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
When a royal messenger rode through the gates of a
town the officers of the lord of the manor and of the
shire alike acknowledged a higher law; and such messengers
were not rare. The sheriff’s accustomed rule
was set aside whenever judges from Westminster sat
in the church or the Guild Hall to administer the
justice of the King’s Court. Sometimes the king’s
escheator came to investigate into lapsed estates, to
ascertain whether any socage tenants had died, and
claim the customary fines.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> From time to time
Court officials “carrying the mace of the lord the king”
appeared to announce statutes or ordinances made in
Parliament; or came as unwelcome commissioners to
ask for benevolences and loans. The king’s clerk of
the market<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> might ride into the town with a troop of
horses and followers carrying weights and measures
signed with the sign of the exchequer; he would call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
for all the town measures, test them by his models,
see that the false ones were burned, and then claim a
fresh relay of horses to carry him on to his next
stage. If the sovereign chose he might send an
officer under the assize of arms to “sit at Bridport to
array the men” and call for archers for the king’s
service; or in case of need the king’s “harbinger” or
“sergeant-at-arms” came to judge how many soldiers
should be billeted on the inhabitants. In time of rebellion
or civil war,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> suspicion of disaffection might
fall upon the town, and then commissioners travelled
from London to hold a special “inquisition” on the
spot.</p>

<p>IV. All these officers represented the king as supreme
head of the law; but other messengers came from the
court, as unbidden and unwelcome as the last, who
claimed for the sovereign a tribute which belonged to
his personal dignity and state. When the monarch
travelled he carried his own law with him; wherever
he went the steward and marshal of his house had
jurisdiction for twelve miles to be counted from
the lodging of the king;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and their authority superseded
all other law whether of the borough or the
shire. The marshal demanded such supply of horses
as was necessary for the king or his messengers;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
purveyors and larderers and officers of the household
levied provisions on all townsfolk,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> save the few who
had been lucky enough to gain the king’s grant of
protection,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> seized what they needed of their corn and
bread and salted meats, called out the inhabitants
for forced labour, billeted the crowd that made up the
royal train on the various householders,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and in fact
governed at their own will any town through which
the king passed. A happy obscurity and distance
from the court could alone preserve a little borough
like Bridport from exactions of royal travellers; and
its people might bear with resignation a poverty and
insignificance which at least protected them from evils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of so great magnitude to poor and over-tasked
workers.</p>

<p>V. There was yet another form in which the power
of the crown pressed upon the inhabitants of a borough.
Privileges granted by the king might be withdrawn at
his caprice; and the burghers lay absolutely at his
mercy for all the liberties and rights which they
enjoyed. At the beginning of every reign the confirmation
of their charters, and the affixing of the
new king’s seal, had to be won by such payments and
bribes as the officials in high places judged that the
burghers could afford.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The king might at any
moment raise a question as to the value of their
charters; or he might make some public revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
or local disturbance the occasion for a revision or a
threatened withdrawal of ancient “customs.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> When
their rights were menaced the townsmen had but one
resource, and hastily met together, as in the case of
Bridport, to order by the “common assent” that
reins and horse nets should be provided at the public
cost and sent to London, for “furthering the common
business.”</p>

<p>For the whole of this complicated system of
administration was kept in working order by a generous
system of bribes&mdash;bribes given largely and
openly, registered in the public accounts, and granted
indifferently to any official, great or small, who
might be induced by a timely gift to “show his friendship.”
Towns won the renewal or the preservation
of their chartered rights by offerings to king or queen,
to chancellors and bishops and great officers of the
household, with whom they interceded by the aid of
a “cow-pull” of swans or cygnets or heronshaws,
a porpoise, a store of dried sprats, or a cask of
wine. “The law is ended as a man is friended,”
said the wise folk of the fifteenth century, and if any
legal question arose the town could only “have a
verdict” when due “courtesies,” as they were called,
were prepared for justices and their clerks, barons of
the exchequer and sheriffs and counsel and attorneys,
besides any sums required to pay a “friendly” jury.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
If the king sent pressing and overwhelming demands
for money, a deputation of leading burghers would
hurry up to Westminster, carrying gifts and bribes to
the Clerk of the Rolls and the usher of Parliament
as a peace offering.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Or some gracious patron might
be persuaded to divert from the town “a quest of the
Admiralty, that it would not come thither as was intended
to come.”<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> When men were called out for
war the community would consult by what gifts or
“courtesies” it might arrange “to have pardoning
that we should not ride up so many men as the
said warrant commanded.”<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> At the appearance of
the King’s harbinger or sergeant-at-arms the first
thought was to collect a sum which might induce
their formidable guest to limit the number of troops
billeted on the town, or even to march them away
altogether.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> In the same way if a messenger appeared
bearing part of the body of a traitor who
had been executed, which by the King’s orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was to be set up on the gate of the borough, the
inhabitants would give him a present to carry on his
burden to some other town.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Counted among the usual incidents of government,
and reckoned in the ordinary expenditure of the
municipality, the payment of such bribes was to all
concerned merely the customary mode of defraying
some of the expenses of administration;<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> and the
public sense acquiesced in a prudent and necessary
method of carrying on the affairs of state. Gifts
to great officials were not tokens of servitude required
only from dependent towns, but a tribute
levied as rigorously from the free boroughs. The
bribes demanded were not less in number; the main
difference was that they went into different pockets.
Thus the offerings required from Canterbury when
its municipal existence was most vigorous and self-dependent,
were naturally on a scale unexampled in
a little place such as Bridport.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> The gifts of the
town were scattered far and wide; a pike to a London
lawyer, wine to Master John Fineux the justiciar, a
conger eel to the Dean of Windsor, wine to the chancellor
of the Archbishop of York, payments to the
Bishop of Winchester that the city might “have his
mediation,” gifts to Cardinal Beaufort to win his help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
when it was proposed to change the municipal constitution,
offerings to the Bishop of St. David’s&mdash;who
nominally got a double supply, one present being provided
for the Episcopus Menevensis and another for
the Episcopus de Seynt Taffey<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> to “have their friendship”
with the King in the anxious days of 1483.
Royal dukes and court officers, bishops, chamberlains,
notaries, clerks of the Rolls, knights who had access
to the palace, sheriffs, judges of the king’s court,
were sumptuously feasted, and messengers knocked
at the doors of their lodgings laden with pheasants,
cygnets, capons, rams, oxen, geese, with Rhenish wine,
wine of Tyre, claret, muscatel, and red wine and
white by thirty or fifty gallons at a time. In the
revolutionary times of 1470 the citizens were unluckily
associated with the party of Henry the Sixth,
and for years after their wealth was lavished in buying
back the favour of the court. The Duchess of York,
who had once been accustomed to receive her tribute
of Rhenish wine, red wine, and wine of Tyre, visited
the city in 1471, when her son was in difficulties; but
the prudent citizens now only offered the poor lady
“for bread 12<i>d.</i>” On the other hand when Edward
was again triumphant officers and commissioners of
the king of every degree accepted pheasants, geese,
capons and red wine. The burghers presented to the
Duke of Clarence a load of claret and capons which
it took four men to carry. Soon after when the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Chamberlain came to Canterbury, he was given his
dinner at the “Swan,” one of the inns belonging to
the corporation, where he feasted off “a wild beast
called a bukk” which had been brought from Westen-hanger;
and after the dinner eight men carried a
peace-offering to his inn, two swans, two fat capons,
four capons, four pheasants, fifty-six gallons of red
wine, and half a gallon of muscatel; and shortly
after another tribute was sent up to him in London.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>But behind this customary system of bribes and
gifts lay the deep and permanent trouble of perpetual
uncertainty and dread. Everywhere authority came
home to the unhappy subjects as a mere matter of
arbitrary and violent caprice, and the main function
of government as that of rough extortion and
successful pillage; while the recognition of privilege
on every side blotted out all sense of equality before
the law, and the weak, knowing all their helplessness,
were as anxious to buy the commodity of protection,
as the powerful, conscious of their might, were willing
to make a gain of it. Canterbury sought the patronage
of leading people in the county or the court;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
Norwich profited, so long as he was in favour, by the
protection of Suffolk; York gratefully recognised
the services of the Duke of Gloucester. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
passed through the city, an order was sent out by the
corporation that every alderman and council man
in livery, and every member of any craft in his best
array, should go out to meet him at the gate&mdash;the
commoners being in their places by the early dawn,
at three of the morning, the grand people an hour
later in consideration of their rank. In 1482 the
Duke acted as mediator between the city and the
King in the matter of the election of a mayor, and
the council agreed that in regard of “the great
labour of the good and benevolent lordship,” that
he “have at all times done for the weal of this city,”
the whole community should join in giving him
“a laud and thank;” and the aldermen dressed in
scarlet, with the Council of Twenty-four in murrey
or crimson, attended at the mayor’s house to present
the Duke with a gift of all kinds of wine and fish,
and lead a procession of the whole commonalty to
his lodging at the Friar Austins.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Patronage and protection, however, were dearly
bought at all times, and at any moment their price,
determined by the reckless habits of a lord, or
the necessity of a king, or the greed of a sheriff,
might be raised so as to bring years of confusion
to municipal finances. Demands sudden and irregular,
which no wisdom could calculate beforehand
and no prudence could avert, wasted the substance of
the people; and thrifty burghers learned to measure
their progress to independence by their success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
in limiting the pleas which the great could urge
as reasons for levying toll and tribute on their
labour. The love of liberty was forced on them by
the practical needs of life. A people long used to
hardship, dependent on the capricious mercy of
their masters, subject without appeal to impositions
laid on them by the stronger hand, they
learned by daily experience that government by
laws made without their own consent, and administered
by officers imposed on them against their
will, was the very definition of slavery. By a rude
experience of alien officials they were effectually
taught that the first necessity of a free community
was the right of choosing its own governors, that
the control of life and goods and the responsibilities
of any office of honour and profit and trust
in the town should no longer be entrusted to
strangers, but committed into the hands of their
own fellow citizens, of whose fidelity, patriotism,
and credit they could assure themselves. It was
impossible that all the fortunes of their commerce
should hang on the will of some distant master
whose faculty of ruling them in all their concerns
rested on the mere superiority of power; and traders
everywhere demanded authority to order their own
business, and rule their markets. The inhabitants
of a town could not claim the property in
their own borough till they had secured the right
of holding it directly from the crown at a yearly
rent which they themselves should pay into the
exchequer at Westminster;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and even then their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
privileged existence was a mere matter of royal
caprice till they found means to have the corporate
succession of the borough legally recognized.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
Their municipality was threatened with financial
calamities unless they could win exemption from
the Statute of Mortmain, and obtain the right of
holding property for the town’s good.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The bondage
under which they lay to the sheriff<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and tax-gatherer
could only be broken when they were given
full powers to assess and collect all their own
taxes.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Vexed and impoverished by journeys to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
distant courts for justice, harassed by the interference
in their most private affairs of some far-off
governor, forced in every recurring emergency to
carry appeals for justice or petitions for favour to an
alien power separate from all their interests, they
urged the claim that right should be done to the
burghers in their own courts and by their own officers
as of the very essence of any true liberty. “We
are the citizens of our lord the king,” said the burghers
of Hereford, “and have the custody of his city for us
and for his heirs and for our heirs, and we ought not
to go out of our city for the recovering of our debts,
for divers dangers and misfortunes which might
happen to our wives and children; and if we ought
to spend our goods and chattels in parts afar off, by
impleading and labouring for that, by that means and
the like we shall be impoverished; and being made
poor, we shall not have wherewith to keep the city,
and so disinheritance by such ways would easily fall
upon our children.”<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> And as the burghers claimed
that each community should have absolute control
over its members for the peace and order of the
commonwealth, so they were resolute that no powerful
patron, within or without the borough, should on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
any plea whatever venture to aid or “maintain” a
townsman who had offended against the municipal
law, “because by such maintainers or protectors a
common contention might arise amongst us, and
horrible manslaughter be committed amongst us, and
the loss of the liberty or freedom of the city to
the disinheritance of us and our children; which God
forbid that in our days by the defect of us, should
happen or fall out in such a manner.”<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> From the
first they were forced to look beyond the question
of mere personal regard, seeing how deeply
legal forms of procedure affected their common life as
a separate society, and they had their grave reasons
of state for insisting that the older forms of administering
justice in their courts should be maintained,
and trial by combat rejected and abolished
from among them, “by reason of perpetual enmity of
us the parents and of our children, which might turn
to the ruin or perdition of the city and other
innumerable accident dangers.”<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> In the same way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
they were driven to realize the necessity of having
some share in deciding on the laws by which they
were to be governed, and which might have the
gravest results to their little state; as, for example,
when the people of Leicester petitioned for a charter
from Henry the Third to do away with the ancient
usage of “borough English,” and grant the right of
inheritance to the eldest son, since owing to defective
heirs and their weakness, the town was falling into
ruin and dishonour.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>All these privileges and exemptions were matters of
negociation between the borough and the king or the
lord of the manor to be bought for money, or for
political support, or for loans in time of need.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The
people everywhere simply won such advantages as
time and opportunity allowed, and secured benefits
which were measured by the grace of the king, or by
the price they could afford to pay, or by the show of
resistance they could make to their lord. Nor was
there anything startling or revolutionary about the first
beginnings of independent municipal life. The town
assemblies which discussed and inaugurated a new constitution
transacted their business with a completeness
and accuracy of methodical routine which might
kindle the sympathy of a Town Council of modern
Birmingham. In the organization of “meetings” the
mediæval Englishman seems to have had nothing to
learn, and the doings of the people of Ipswich when
they got their first charter from King John in 1200
carry us into the quiet atmosphere of a board-room
where shareholders and directors of some solid and old-established
company assemble for business with the
decorum and punctuality of venerable habit.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> The
charter granted those essential privileges which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
recognized by all boroughs as of the very first importance&mdash;the
right henceforward to deal in financial
matters directly with the Exchequer, and no longer
act as a mere fragment of the shire through the sheriff;
to be free of tolls on trade throughout the kingdom,
and have a Guild Merchant with all its commercial
privileges; to carry out justice according to the ancient
custom of the borough; and to elect each year from
among themselves officers to rule over the town, who
being thus appointed by common consent could only
be removed from office by the unanimous counsel of
the whole people. The charter was given on May 25,
and in the following month a general assembly of the
burghers was summoned. At this meeting they first
elected the chief officers for the year, the bailiffs and
coroners, and then proceeded to decide by common
counsel that a body of twelve “Portmen” should be appointed
to assist them; and three days later these too
were formally chosen through another and more complicated
system of election by a select body of citizens
named for the purpose. Having taken an oath faithfully
to govern the borough and maintain its liberties,
and justly to render the judgments of its courts, the
new officers then caused all the townsmen to stretch
forth their hands towards the Book, and with one voice
solemnly swear from that hour to obey and assist
them in guarding the liberties of the town. Twelve
days after this they met to ordain the most necessary
rules for the administration of the town. Two months
were then spent in drawing up “Ordinances” which
were finally solemnly read to the whole people assembled
in the churchyard, and received their unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
consent. And lastly a month later, on October 12,
the organization of the Merchant Guild for the
regulation of trade was completed and its officers
elected; the newly made Common Seal<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> was inspected;
and the community ordered that a record of all their
laws and free customs should be written for perpetual
remembrance in a roll to be called Domesday. And
thus with all the grave ceremony which befitted the
dignity of a new republic, Ipswich started on its independent
career as a free borough.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">BATTLE FOR FREEDOM</p>

<p class="pch">(1.) <i>Towns on Royal Demesne</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> auspicious a beginning of municipal life as was
granted to Ipswich did not however fall as a matter
of course to the lot of every English town, nor was
political liberty by any means an inevitable consequence
of favourable commercial conditions, or necessarily
withheld from boroughs in a humbler way of
trade. In a society where all towns alike depended
upon some lord of the manor who owned the soil and
exercised feudal rights over his tenants, that which
mainly determined for each community the measure of
independence it should win, and the price which its
people should pay for liberty, was the form of lordship
to which it was subject. By the decisive
accidents of position and tenure the fate of the town
was fixed, rather than by the merits or exertions of
the burghers.</p>

<p>First among the boroughs in number and importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
were those in “ancient demesne”&mdash;that is,
boroughs which held directly from the king, and were
therefore reckoned as being a part of the national
property, such as Canterbury, York, Winchester,
Southampton, Yarmouth, Nottingham, Gloucester,
and so on. A second group was formed by the
towns which belonged to a lay noble, like Morpeth,
Berkeley, or Leicester; or were held by him as a special
grant from the king, as Barnstaple or Liverpool.
Finally there were the towns on ecclesiastical estates,
whether they were the property of a bishopric like
Lynn, which was under the Bishop of Norwich, Wells
under the Bishop of Wells, Romney and Hythe under
the Archbishop of Canterbury; or whether they owed
suit and fealty to a convent, as the towns of Reading
and St. Albans, which belonged to the abbots of those
monasteries respectively, Fordwich to St. Augustine’s
at Canterbury, Weymouth to St. Swithun’s at Winchester.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
In all these various groups the towns
were equally willing to relieve their feudal superior,
king or lord or bishop, of the cares of government,
and the only question was how far the king would
go in supporting these demands, or how far the noble
and ecclesiastic could be compelled to acquiesce in a
re-distribution of feudal jurisdiction and privileges in
favour of traders and “mean” people.</p>

<p>Happily for the national wealth and freedom the
great majority of towns in England, and almost all
those of importance, were part of the royal demesne,
and the king was lord of the soil. Fenced in by privileges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
which had been devised to protect the interest of
the King, and which they gradually found means to
transform into institutions for the protection of
their own interests, the burghers on ancient demesne
were bound into one fellowship by the inheritance of
a common tradition and common immunities;<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> and
regarding their towns as the very aristocracy among
the boroughs, enjoyed a self-conscious dignity such
as the Great Powers of Europe might feel towards
the less favoured minor States. There is the
ring of a haughty spirit in the answer sent by
the men of Hereford when the people of Cardiff
begged for a copy of their “customs” to help them
in deciding on the constitution of their own government.
“The King’s citizens of Hereford,” they say,
“who have the custody of his city (in regard that
it is the principal city of all the market towns
from the sea even unto the bounds of the Severn)
ought of ancient usage to deliver their laws and
customs to such towns when need requires, yet in this
case they are in no wise bound to do it, because they
say they are not of the same condition; for there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
some towns which hold of our Lord the King of
England and his heirs without any mesne lord; and
to such we are bound, when and as often as need shall
be, to certify of our laws and customs, chiefly because
we hold by one and the same tenure; and nothing
shall be taken of them in the name of a reward, except
only by our common town clerk for the writing and
his pains as they can agree. But there are other
market towns which hold of divers lords of the kingdom
wherein are both natives and rustics of ancient
time, who pay to their lords corporal service of divers
kinds, with other services which are not used among
us, and who may be expelled out of those towns by
their lords, and may not inhabit in them or be restored
to their former state, but by the common law of
England.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> And chiefly those and others that hold by
such foreign services in such towns are not of our
condition; neither shall they have our laws and
customs but by way of purchase, to be performed to
our Capital Bailiff as they can agree between them,
at the pleasure and to the benefit of the city aforesaid.”<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>I. Singular advantages, indeed, fell to the lot of
towns thus happily situated on the national estate. The
King was a Lord of the Manor too remote to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
opportunity for overmuch meddling, and too greatly
occupied with affairs of state to concern himself
with the details of government in his numerous
boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> County magnates might cling passionately
to the right of holding local courts as sources of power,
and yet more important sources of wealth; but such
rights were of small consequence to a powerful
sovereign, who as supreme head of the law could
call up criminals to his own judgement seat from
every court in the country.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Confidence of supremacy
made him careless to put it to the test by abrupt
assertions of authority, as private owners, apprehensive
and uncertain, might be tempted to do; and in his
indifference to small uses of power and devices for
paltry gain, he held loosely to rights that brought
much trouble and little profit.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> So long as his yearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
ferm was punctually paid,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> he was ready to grant to
the townsfolk leave to gather into their own treasury
the petty sums collected at the borough or manor
courts,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> or to make their mayor the king’s escheator;
and while he thus won their gratitude and friendship
he lost nothing by his generosity. In surrendering
local claims for a fixed payment, he not only
relieved himself of the charge of salaries to a multitude
of minor officials, but he had no longer to
suffer from the loss of fines and dues and forfeitures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
which were nominally levied for the King, but which
had a constant tendency to find their way into the
pockets of the town officers or the tax-collectors rather
than into his exchequer. In many cases, moreover, he
may have gained considerably by the price which he
demanded for his favours; and the royal accounts
possibly give a very inadequate record of the number
of special gifts of money and yearly annuities paid by
boroughs to the King in return for liberties granted to
them.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>II. As lord of the manor, therefore, the King was a
liberal master, always ready to arrange a compromise
with his tenants as to vexatious feudal claims. But
he was equally ready to listen to their prayers for
freedom from the control of officers of the Shire and
the Hundred. So long as it was to the benefit of the
central authority to break up and weaken provincial
governments, to curtail the powers of the sheriff, to
confound ambitious designs of local magnates, and
shatter pretensions on the part of the nobles which
might tend to strengthen hereditary enemies of the
crown, so long the townspeople might count on
the sovereign’s support in the struggle for independence.
In questions therefore that arose as to rival
jurisdictions, in claims put forward by a borough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
against neighbouring lords for rights of navigation
or pasturage or fishing, in all disputes which were
carried in the last resort to the arbitration of the
king, his sympathy, especially if a fitting “courtesy”
was offered by the burghers, was with his borough.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Powers won from local governments or from feudal
lords were divided between the King and the municipality;
and under shelter of the royal authority
large rights of local self-government were rapidly
gathered into the burghers’ hands. Functions once
exercised by the bailiff of the hundred and the
sheriff of the county were handed over to the mayor;
he collected the fee-ferm, held the view of frankpledge,
levied taxes,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> mustered the men-at-arms, and
presided over civil and criminal courts.</p>

<p>III. Nor was there any serious difficulty as to the
exercise of the sovereign rights of the crown. To the
King it mattered little whether he sent a special
deputy direct from the court, or whether he delegated
powers to the mayor, and used him as an
official immediately responsible to the crown; while
on the other hand such a change meant much
present solace to the townsfolk. A compromise
was therefore easily brought about between the
monarch and the people. The mayor was invariably
appointed as the King’s Clerk of the Market, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Measurer and Gauger at the King’s Standard, the
Manager of the King’s Assize; he became the representative
of the sovereign in the most important
charges of administration, as one of the King’s
Justices<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> in the town, as Admiral,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> as Mayor of
the Staple. Administrative changes such as these
left the power of the sovereign untouched and cost
him nothing; while on the other hand the central
government was by this means provided with a
ready-made staff of trained officials,&mdash;a staff which
the King could not possibly have created,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> nor paid
out of his empty exchequer even if he had been
able to create it&mdash;but which had become absolutely
essential for carrying out the supervision of local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
affairs at a time when such supervision was growing
more important every day, from the point of view
both of the King and of the people. The towns on
their side, relieved by the new system from miseries<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
under which they had suffered, readily forgot distinctions
between laws made by them and made
for them, so long as these were administered by
officers of whom they were allowed the election and
control.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>IV. Finally if the towns suffered from the officers
of the royal household, a remedy was easily
granted them. The sovereign found no personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
inconvenience in transferring the duties of these
officers to the governors of the boroughs themselves;
and the mayor or bailiff became the King’s Steward,
and Marshal of the King’s Household in the
borough. In short, as the towns advanced to
independence, all manner of powers and responsibilities
were heaped together on their chief officer,
with no clear discrimination between his various
and oddly mingled functions. Men did not pause
to ask which of his masters the mayor at any given
moment was serving, whether he was acting as head
of the city government to carry out the burghers’
will, or as the officer appointed by the sovereign
to execute his laws;<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and nice questions as to
the exact division of authority which had really
taken place were so manifestly irrelevant in presence
of the harmonious concentration of all power in a
single hand, that jealousies and suspicions on both
sides were allayed, to the great furtherance of
peace and concord. To the mediæval poet who
drew a picture of Love as “the leader of our Lord’s
folk in Heaven,” standing as a “mean” or mediator
of peace, there was one obvious comparison&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“as the mayor is between the King and the
commons.”<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The history of the royal boroughs, therefore, so
far as their relations with the King are concerned,
reduces itself into a long list of favours asked and
given. Frequent troubles of state no doubt stimulated
the generosity of sovereigns; and times of
political disturbance and revolution proved occasions
when the towns rose into independence through
the necessities of kings, who confirmed old franchises
and granted new ones, and “right largely made
charters thereof, to the intent to have the more good-will
and love in their land.”<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The civil wars under
Henry the Second,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> the money difficulties of Richard
and John, the troubled minority of Henry the
Third, the disorders under Edward the Second,
the commercial policy of Edward the Third, the
political insecurity of Henry the Fourth after his
seizure of the throne, the financial needs of Henry
the Fifth, the tumults and fears of the reign of
Henry the Sixth, the anxiety of Edward the Fourth
to conciliate the kingdom,&mdash;all these were so many
heaven-sent opportunities for the burghers to win
new instalments of local liberty; while the two
periods of reaction brought about by the fear of the
Peasant Revolt under Richard the Second, and the
nervous apprehensions of Richard the Third, were
themselves made use of by the governing class in
the boroughs to confirm and tighten their authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
So monotonous indeed is the record of the burghers
on the royal demesne, all moving together along
the same well-beaten road to independence, winning
the same privileges, even winning them at the same
time,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> that a brief statement of liberties secured by
any single city will serve to illustrate the general
history of all.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Henry the Second Norwich enjoyed
certain liberties and privileges, but its citizens
were practically feudal servants of the King, who
appointed their governors, took the profits of their
courts, and looked on the city as a private possession
of his own. Their true freedom began with the charter
granted them in 1194 by Richard the First.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> They
were to have the customs of London; the burgesses
might not be summoned to answer any plea outside
the city; they were henceforth to elect their own
Provost, “such as may be fitting to us and to them;”
and they were allowed to hold their city at a ferm rent
of £108 a year, which they themselves, instead of the
sheriff, should collect and pay to the Exchequer. For
the confirmation of their rights, “and for having
the city in their hand,” the Norwich people paid
200 marks.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> From this time the provost took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the place of the officer formerly appointed by the
King, presided over the Borough Court in the Tolbooth
and possibly held the view of frankpledge, and
paid the fines of the courts into the city treasury.
The sheriff of the county, however, still held a higher
court, the <i>Curia Comitatus</i>, within the enclosure of
the castle, where he exercised criminal jurisdiction,
and jurors made the presentments ordered by the
assize of Clarendon.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>But this power of the sheriff only lingered on
for a few years. In 1223 a new arrangement was
made between the citizens and Henry the Third.
Norwich consisted of four distinct divisions which
had been naturally formed out of the four hamlets
created by the first settlers and which had by degrees
become united into a single town:&mdash;<i>Conesford</i>,
where the earliest comers gathered round the ford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
over the river, protected by the stream on one side,
and on the other by the mound on which the castle
stood in later days; the <i>Westwick</i>, whose name
shews its later foundation, and which lay on the
further side of the fortifications, within the bend
of the river; the <i>Magna Crofta</i> or big field of the
castle, lying below the entrenchments midway between
Conesford and Westwick, which was made at
the Conquest into a new ward, Mancroft Ward; and
the <i>Ward-over-the-Water</i> on the further bank of the
river, somewhat cut off from the rest of the town.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>
For the government of these “leets,” as the divisions
came to be called, it was decided in 1223 that the
burghers should elect four bailiffs, one for each district.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
There was no longer to be any provost, since
the bailiffs were to take his place in joint government
of the town, and were further to take over the criminal
jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the sheriff in
his court at the castle. From this time therefore
most of the social, commercial, and criminal affairs of
the city lay in the burghers’ own hands.</p>

<p>The four bailiffs, however, had still no control over
the castle and its entrenchments, nor over a wide
reach of land that lay along the river, stretching past
Conesford and Mancroft and Westwick&mdash;land owned
by the prior and convent; nor had they any authority
over the cathedral, the priory, and the bishop’s
palace that lay within Westwick, nor over property
owned by them or by other ecclesiastical bodies which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
penetrated into the heart of the city; while on the
other hand tenants of castle and prior and bishop
were all making their profit out of the city trade, and
enjoying its peace and protection. Therefore the next
claim of the burghers necessarily was that the King
should give to the municipality authority to tax for
the common expenses all inhabitants alike, under
whatever lord they held; and in 1229 they obtained
a royal grant that all “who should partake of the
liberties which we have granted to the said citizens
of Norwich ... shall be taxed and give aid as
the said citizens;” and that “if anyone has withdrawn
from their customs and scots, he shall return
to their society and custom, and follow their scot,
so that no one shall be quit therefrom.”<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> There
was no trifling with the municipal authority in this
matter; in 1236 and 1237 when the tenants of castle
and prior attempted to resist the claim on their
moneys, the sheriff was ordered to summon them
before him to show by what right or warrant
they claimed acquittance from payments to the city
treasury; and again in 1276, when the tenants of
the castle refused to pay their share of taxes, the
case was brought before the barons of the exchequer,
and an order came from Westminster that the sheriff
was forthwith to levy the sum due and hand it over
to the city.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Henry the Third granted many other favours “to
our beloved citizens of Norwich,” feeling perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
advantage of their friendship amid the increasing
troubles of his reign; and the burghers of Norwich
certainly, like those of Winchester, took sides with
him in the war against Simon de Montfort.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> In 1253
they had been allowed to enclose their city with a
ditch.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> In 1255 (twenty years before a general law
was passed to this effect for all Englishmen), they
were freed from arrest for debt of which they were
not sureties or principal debtors. And in 1256 Henry
granted a charter which ordered that the “citizens
shall answer at our exchequer by their own hands for
all debts and demands ... and that no sheriff or
other bailiff of ours shall henceforth enter the city
aforesaid to make distresses for any debts;” which
decreed further that all merchants who shared in the
Norwich liberties and merchandises were to pay the
city taxes “wheresoever they shall make their residences;”
and which ordained lastly that “no guild
shall henceforth be held in the aforesaid city to the
injury of the said city.”<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The sheriff was thus
finally shut out from all land or houses held by the
citizens; and absent merchants were subjected to
their lot and scot.</p>

<p>From Edward the First the citizens in 1305 obtained
the right to hold the Leet of Newgate in Norwich,
which the King had “lately recovered against the
Prior of Holy Trinity”; and further paid a fine down,
and promised to pay £10 yearly into the Exchequer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for ever, for a charter granting that they should
not be impleaded outside the city; that they should
not be convicted by any foreigners but only by their
co-citizens, save in matters touching the King or the
whole commonalty; that the bailiffs should have
power to assess tallages and other reasonable aids “by
the assent of the whole of the commonalty, or of the
greater part of the same” for the protection and advantage
of the city, and to make “reasonable distresses”
for the levying of these tallages as was done in other
cities; and that they should hold the Leet of Newgate
which the Crown had “lately recovered against the
Prior of Holy Trinity.”<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Further the burghers remembered
a trouble into which they had fallen in
the case of a thief who had stolen some cloth and
brought much sorrow on the city; for having fled
to the church of St. George he finally escaped out
of it though the door was guarded by four parishes,
who were all fined for their lax vigilance; then being
caught and condemned by the bailiffs and commonalty
he was condemned to be hung, but at his burial found
to be still alive, and the man who had cut him down
was thrown into prison; and lastly the bailiffs were
accused of illegal action in hanging him “without any
man’s suit and without capture in the act,” and of
“taking up thieves and malefactors for trespasses
done outside the city and executing judgement on
them in the city,” and the city liberties had been
seized into the King’s hands, and a royal officer set to
rule over them.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> So the burghers in 1307 presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a petition that the right of infang theof and outfang
theof, which they had used at all times “whereof
memory runneth not,” might now be definitely inserted
in their charter. Further, since the sheriff
“by malice” still found means on one excuse or another
to arrest a citizen from time to time&mdash;and
this though the Norwich people had the return of
all manner of writs<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> so that neither the sheriff nor
any foreign bailiff had any right to meddle with
them&mdash;they required of the King that at their demand
every citizen thus seized should be delivered
over to them out of the hands of the alien. Likewise
they prayed that so long as a burgher lived in the city
he should never be required to attend any foreign
court whatever by reason of any foreign tenure he
might hold; and that no foreign tenement should give
the right to sheriffs or foreign bailiff to summon him
to be in juries or inquests outside the city. Lastly,
as a protection against any danger of forfeiting their
franchise by failure to pay the ferm rent, they asked
permission for the corporation to hold in perpetual
possession certain lands and houses the profits of which
might be set apart for the rent.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Under Edward the Third the sheriff of the county
was deprived of his last plea for interference
within the city walls. Up to this time he had still
collected rents and taxes and done justice for the
tenants of the Castle Fee; and the ditches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Castle and the Fee, thus freed from city rule, had
been made a sort of refuge for felons and malefactors
flying from the jurisdiction of the city officers.
All this, however, was in 1346 handed over to the
bailiffs, and the sheriff was in no wise to interfere.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
Moreover, in consideration of the cost to which the
citizens had gone in enclosing the city, they were
set free for ever from the jurisdiction of the clerk
of the market of the King’s household.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Norwich
was further given its own Admiral, who sailed about in
the “admiral’s barge,” and who held admiralty courts
and administered its law.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> In 1331 it became a
Staple town, and its mayor was made a mayor of the
Staple, with a salary of £20 and a seal given by the
king.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Norwich people had been gradually
perfecting their own internal system of government&mdash;a
system which will be described in a
later chapter&mdash;and in the difficulties of Henry the
Fourth they found opportunity to complete their
work. A sum of £1,000 given to the King,
besides heavy fines paid in bribes on all sides,
secured in 1403 a charter which finally guaranteed
to them the constitution of their choice.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Norwich
was made into a county of itself. A mayor was
appointed, who was given supreme rights of jurisship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>”
in the city, and received from the King himself
a sword which was to be carried before him with
the point erect, along with the gold or silver maces
borne by the serjeants-at-mace. The four bailiffs
were replaced by two sheriffs, also elected by the burgesses,
who were charged with matters concerning the
interests of the crown which had formerly been the
business of the bailiffs, and were responsible for the
yearly rent of the city. The mayor was appointed
the King’s escheator, and thus the last office which
had been reserved in alien hands was given over to
the municipality. Finally in token of the consummation
of the municipal hopes the old seal of the
bailiffs was abolished to make way for a new city seal.</p>

<p>Norwich was but one among a number of
boroughs whose inhabitants quietly and steadily
gathered to themselves the liberties that made them
free, for in the fellowship of towns holding of the
King under a uniform tenure throughout the “ancient
demesne,” the list of privileges granted to any one
became the model for its neighbours near and far.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
With orderly progression, unbroken by any of the
violent and dramatic incidents that indicate a time
of conflict, all the bigger towns won by gradual instalments
complete local independence. Such changes
of method as we observe are simply changes made
necessary by new national legislation, such as the
form of incorporation required after the Statute
of Mortmain,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> or the right to elect Justices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Peace when one power after another had been given
to these officers by law.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> We do not distinguish
seasons of plentiful harvest and periods barren of all
growth; in one century as in another Kings stooped
to accept the “courtesies” offered, and granted the
favours solicited. Nor do we find records of advantages
hastily given and timidly withdrawn; or,
until the reign of Richard the Third,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> is there
any suggestion of anxiety on the part of Kings
to check or limit the free action of the boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
Up to that time rulers of the state seem to have
had no apprehension of peril to public order, of
jeopardy to trading interests, of injury to the administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of justice, of possible usurpations by
the municipalities which might bring them into collision
with the ordered forces of the world; and for
three hundred years statesmen freely allowed the
growth of municipal ambition, and gave full scope
for the developement of all the various systems of
local self-government. The full importance of these
facts only becomes clear when we turn to the history
of the towns that were under subjection to other lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
than the nation itself; and compare the peaceful
negotiations by which matters were arranged between
the royal boroughs and the State, with the
violence of feeling aroused when the misgivings
and alarms of private owners were brought into
the controversy.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Battle for Freedom</span></p>

<p class="pch">(2) <i>Towns on Feudal Estates</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the King’s lands, as we have seen, the
interests of the monarch never came into collision
with the interests of his burghers, and the townsfolk
found an easy way to liberty. From time to
time they presented a petition for freedom, brought
their gifts to win the sovereign’s favour, and joyfully
carried back to their fellow citizens a new charter
of municipal privileges. But the condition of the
towns that belonged to noble or baron was doubly
depressed from the standpoint of their happier neighbours.
Of secondary importance alike in numbers,
in wealth, or in influence, as compared to those on
royal demesne, they for the most part never emerged
into any real consequence; while their lord had
every reason to oppose the growth of independence
in his boroughs, and lacked nothing for its complete
suppression but the requisite power. New franchises
were extorted from his weakness rather than won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
from his good will, and where acquiescence in the
town’s liberties was not irresistibly forced on him
his opposition was dogged and persevering.</p>

<p>The dispute was none the less intense because
under the conditions of English life the controversy
between the town and the feudal lord was limited
within a very narrow field; for the burghers saw well
how the lord’s claims to supremacy might permanently
fetter an active community of traders,
and on this point townspeople fought with a pertinacity
determined by the conviction that all
their hopes of prosperity depended on victory. To
manufacturers and merchants the rule of an alien
governor was fatal; trade died away before vexatious
checks and arbitrary imposts, and enterprising
burghers hastened to forsake the town where prosperity
was stunted and liberty uncertain, and take
up citizenship in a more thriving borough. Success
and emancipation went hand in hand; for the
effects of a maimed and imperfect freedom were always
disastrous and far-reaching, and there is not a
single instance of an English town which remained
in a state of dependence and which was at the
same time prosperous in trade.</p>

<p>One or two instances will be enough to show the
extent and character of the traders’ claim for “liberties.”
The burghers of Totnes, who had been fined
for having a Guild by Henry the Second, had no
sooner succeeded in securing its authorisation from
John than they at once made it a weapon of offence,
and a formidable weapon too with its roll of more
than three hundred members, against their lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
control of the town market and of the shopkeepers.
The Guild claimed the right to admit non-residents to
their company, so that these might freely trade without
paying any tribute to the lord for one year, after that
giving six pence annually; and pretended to have
authority to test weights and measures without orders
from the lord’s bailiff; to hold the assize of bread and
ale and receive fines; and apparently to deal out
justice for petty offences. These usurpations of his
rights were discussed between the lord and his tenants
with riots and contentions, in which the lord proved
victorious in 1304, forcing the burghers to submit
on every point in which the Guild tried to bring in
customs which lay beyond the ancient rights of the
community. They were forbidden to admit to the
Guild anyone who had not a house in the town, and
non-residents had to take oaths before his bailiff to
pay a yearly fine to the lord. No trial of weights and
measures could take place till orders had been issued
to the Seneschal of the Guild by the lord’s bailiff;
when the trial came on bailiff and town provost sat
beside him in the Guildhall to hear the charges, and
even then all false or suspected measures were to be
kept by the provost till the lord’s next court. On
the other hand the bailiff might hold a trial of measures
whenever he judged that he could do the business
better. So also the assize of bread was given to the
lord’s bailiff sitting with the provost of the town; all
suspected bread and weights were to be seized by
him, the offenders to be fined in the lord’s court, all
punishments by tumbril or pillory inflicted by his
orders, and all proceeds of fines given over to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Lastly when small thefts and riots were to be judged
the bailiff sat by the town officers and as many
burgesses as chose to come, and took his share in the
proceedings&mdash;though occasionally in his absence the
town officers might act by common consent of the
community.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Such was the comparative helplessness of a community
which, with all its tenacity of purpose, could
neither urge custom nor tradition on its side in
pleading for independent rights. In the borough of
Barnstaple, on the other hand, which had been
granted by the King<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> to Sir John Cornwall and his
wife the Countess of Huntingdon, we have an instance
of the immense advantages possessed by a town which
though now in private ownership, inherited the
tradition of privilege which its people had won as
tenants of ancient demesne.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> In 1423 the Mayor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Aldermen, and capital burgesses drew up a list of byelaws
for the good government of the borough, which
apparently stirred the apprehensions of its lords.
For a few years later, reviving ancient traditions of
feudal authority in a suit against the borough, they
complained that the mayor and burgesses had of their
own authority admitted as “Burgesses of the Wynde”
“foreign” merchants and victuallers who merely
visited the town; and had turned to their own use
the fines from denizens pertaining to their lord; that
they had taken the correction of bread and ale, and
unlawfully seized fines and tolls; that they would not
suffer his officers to take custom after ancient usage
from the people of Wales for their merchandise; and
that they even seized fines belonging to him for heaps
of rubbish in the streets. Moreover they did not render
the suit and service due to the lord’s court from all
the inhabitants of the borough, for without his
leave they themselves held a court every Monday,
and instead of coming to every court of the lord’s
steward they did not come oftener than twice a year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
nor would they suffer the lord’s officers to make
attachments in the borough at the Nativity of Our
Mother after the ancient custom. In other words the
townsfolk, just like the people of Totnes two hundred
years before, were bent on regulating their trade and
spending the money collected in their courts and
markets; but they were happier than they of Totnes
in being able to claim that all these so-called usurpations
were ancient rights of the burgesses, by virtue,
as they said, of a charter granted by King Athelstan
500 years before. As this charter however had
unluckily been “casualiter amissa,” the town had
to fall back on the verdict of an inquisition held
about 1300 as to the usages and franchises to which
it was entitled, and the payments which were due
by the mayor and commonalty in place of old feudal
services. Here the Barnstaple men held their own
successfully, and in 1445 they secured a charter
from Henry the Sixth, “for accommodation of the
burgesses in doing their business quietly,” which confirmed
to them the fullest rights of self-government.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>The struggle of the boroughs with their feudal lords
was however a matter of little significance in England,
where since the Conquest feudalism from the point
of view of the noble had so unsatisfactory a record.
Fallen from the high estate of his brethren on the
Continent, despoiled of his might by one strong king
after another, he saw himself condemned to play in
England a comparatively modest part, and from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
less exalted plane was even constrained to assume in
his relations to burghers and traders a conciliatory,
almost at times a deprecating tone, not because
he was lacking in “a high and pompous mind,” but
simply because his fortunes had sunk low. Hence
the conflict in England was of a very different
character from the conflict abroad. Fashions of careful
ceremonial indeed long preserved the traditional
sense of impassable barriers set between the dignity
of the great whose daily needs were supplied by the
labour of others, and the low estate of those who
had to depend upon their own toil. “Whensoever
any nobleman or peer of the realm passed through
any parish, all the bells were accustomed to be rung
in honour of his person, and to give notice of the passage
of such eminency; and when their letters were
upon any occasion read in any assemblies, the commons
present would move their bonnets in token of
reverence to their names and persons.” Burghers and
journeymen with an irreverent laugh at men “evermore
strutting who no store keep,”<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> gathered to see
the noble go by “in his robe of scarlet twelve yards
wide, with pendent sleeves down on the ground,
and the furrur therein set amounting unto £20 or
better,” while a train of followers crowded after
him anxiously holding up with both hands out of
the filth of the mediæval streets the wide sleeves
made to “slide on earth” by their sides, and eagerly
watching lest the ladies should forget to admire “the
plaits behind;” and the busy mockers of the market-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
guessed that tailors and skinners must soon
carry their cloths and skins out into the fields if
they would find space enough to cut out robes like
these.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> But the fine garments and leisurely state of
the great folk, the hollow ornaments of a vanquished
feudalism, were matters of little significance; the
forces of the future lay rather with the crowd of
workers to right and left&mdash;with the men who watched
the brave procession sweep by, and then gathered in
their Common House to decree that any burgher who
put on the livery of a lord, or accepted his maintenance
and protection, should be blotted out of the
book of burgesses, and driven from their market-place
and assembly hall, and “that he come not
among them in their congregations.”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>For the moment, indeed, the noble class was as it
were thrown aside by the strong current of the
national life, nor could the handful of families that
held half the soil of England and the lesser baronage
who followed in their train be recovered of their
impotence, of their impoverishment of intellect and
decay of force, even by the greatest landholder and
the most typical member of their body, Warwick the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Kingmaker. Sated with possessions, forced into a
position of leadership mainly by the imposing list of
his great relations and the surprising number of his
manors&mdash;a patriot who consecrated his services to the
cause of a faction and the unrestrained domination of
a family group of blood relations&mdash;a general who never
got beyond an already antiquated system of warfare,
devoid according to public rumour of personal courage,
deserted in a crisis by the one organised military force
in the public service&mdash;a commander with all the
ready instincts of the common pirate&mdash;a statesman
made after an old ancestral pattern, who had
learned his politics a couple of centuries before his
time, and to the last remained absolutely blind to the
great movements of his own day&mdash;an administrator
who never failed at a critical moment to put in
jeopardy the most important national interests&mdash;an
agitator restless for revolution, but whose influence
in the national counsels was practically of
no account when there was a pause in mere fighting&mdash;it
is thus that Warwick stands before us, a consummate
representative of his demoralized class.</p>

<p>The conditions under which the great landowners
were living at this time were indeed singularly unfavourable.
With the new trade they had comparatively
little to do,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and the noble, with his throng of dependents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and his show of state, was really living from hand
to mouth on the harvests from his fields and the
plunder he got in war.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> After the fashion of the time
the treasure of the family was hoarded up in his great
oak chests; splendid robes, cloth of gold, figured
satins, Eastern damasks and Sicilian silks, velvets and
Flemish cloths, tapestries and fine linen, were heaped
together with rich furs of marten and beaver. Golden
chains and collars of “the old fashion” and “the
new,” rings and brooches adorned with precious stones,
girdles of gold or silver gilt by famous foreign makers,
were stored away in his strong boxes, or in the
safe rooms of monasteries, along with ewers and
goblets and basins of gold and silver, pounced and
embossed “with great large enamels” or covered with
silver of “Paris touch.”<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> But the owner of all this
unproductive treasure scarcely knew where to turn
for a little ready money. The produce of the estate
sufficed for the needs of the household, and if the lord
was called away on the king’s service, or had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
attend Parliament, a supply of oats was carried for
the horses “to save the expenses of his purse”; and
an army of servants rode backwards and forwards
continually to fetch provisions from fields and ponds
and salting tubs at home, so that he should never be
driven to buy for money from the baker or at the
market.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> The crowd of dependents who swelled his
train, easily content to win an idle subsistence, a share
of booty in time of war, “maintenance” in the law
courts, and protection from all enemies, either
received no pay at all, or accepted the most trifling
sums&mdash;a few shillings a year when they could get it,
with a “livery” supplied like their food from the
estate.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> For money which was scarce everywhere was
nowhere so scarce as in the houses of the landed
proprietors, who amid their extravagant display
found one thing always lacking&mdash;a few pounds to
pay an old debt or buy a new coat. Sir John Paston,
the owner of broad estates in Norfolk, was forced
more than once to pawn his “gown of velvet and
other gear” in London to get a few marks; when it
occurred to him to raise money on his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
funeral pall, he found his mother had been beforehand
with him, and had already put it in pawn.
During an unwonted visit to Westminster in 1449,
the poor Lady of Berkeley wrote anxiously to her
husband, one of the greatest landowners in England,
“At the reverence of God send money, or else I
must lay my horse to pledge and come home on
my feet”; and he managed to raise £15 to meet
her needs by pawning the mass book, chalices, and
chasubles of his chapel.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> So also the Plumptons, in
Yorkshire, were in perpetual money difficulties; servants
were unpaid, bills not met, debts of £2 10<i>s.</i>
and £4 put off from term to term, and at last a
friend who had gone surety for a debt of £100
to a London merchant was arrested. “Madam,” a
poor tradesman writes to Lady Plumpton, “ye know
well I have no living but my buying and selling,
and, Madam, I pray you send me my money.”
One of the family tried in vain to get a friend to
buy him some black velvet for a gown. “I pray
you herein blame my non-power, but not my will,”
the friend answers from London, “for in faith I
might not do it but if I should run in papers of
London, which I never did yet, so I have lived
poorly thereafter.”<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> When times grew pressing the
country families borrowed freely from their neighbours
and relations; no one, even the sister of the
Kingmaker, felt any hesitation in pleading poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
as a reason for being off a bargain or asking for a
loan;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> and those who were in better case lent readily
in the hope of finding a like help themselves in
case of difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Year by year debts accumulated,
till the owner’s death allowed the creditors to open
his coffers and scatter his treasured stores, when
the “array, plate, and stuff of the household
and of the chapel” scarcely sufficed to meet the
legacies and bills, the charities deferred, and the
masses required for his soul’s safety.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>There were indeed instances in which the growing
poverty of the nobles opened an easy way for the
emancipation of the towns, since it was sometimes
possible, under the pressure of poverty or bankruptcy,
to convince the lord of a borough, even though he
had but such a measure of good wit in his head</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“As thou shouldest mete of a mist from morn till even,”<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">that the balance of profit lay on the side of freedom.
For to some extent the difficulties of the landowners
arose from the fact that on their estates the commutation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
for feudal services, or dues to be rendered for the
holding of land, had been settled in early times when
money was scarce and demands for profit modest,
and these charges remained fixed when prices were
rising and when the need of ready money was keenly
felt.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> But while the lord could look for no increase
from his lands, a new source of profit had been opened
to him in the boroughs on his estate. He could
find money surely and easily by leasing out rights
of trade, collection of tolls, and other privileges to
the townspeople. In the middle of the thirteenth
century the mayor and burgesses of Berkeley obtained
from their lord freedom from all kinds of toll which
he either demanded or might demand of them;<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
and in the fourteenth century he rented to them the
tolls of the wharfage and of the market, and received
larger profits from this transaction than he gained
from all the rent of the borough.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The weakest corporation moreover had a persistence
and continuity of life which gave it incalculable
advantages in the conflict with individuals subject
to all the chances and changes of mortality. For the
nobles indeed the fight with the town was in many
ways an unequal one. Driven hither and thither
by urgent calls of war or of the King’s business,
the lord was scarcely ever at home to look to his
own affairs. In the frequent absences of the masters
of Berkeley, perpetually called away by “troubles of
state,” when the King summoned them to his aid
whether for civil war or war of conquest,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> the
neighbouring towns of Bristol and Gloucester found
opportunity to escape from their control; and the
march of the baron and his retainers from Berkeley
was a subject of much greater gladness to the
townsmen of Bristol than to the lord of the castle
himself; for “the household and foreign accounts
of this lord,” we are told, “reveal a marvellous unwillingness
in him to this Scottish war, dispatching
many letters and messages to the King, and other
lords and favourites about him, for excuses.”<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
When, as a reward for his services, one of the
Berkeleys was given the custody and government of
the town of Gloucester,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> he was also charged with the
government of Berwick, and was moreover called
away whenever the King found himself in military
difficulties; so that the Gloucester burgesses cannot
have had much to fear from him. The care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
great estates, in fact, was constantly left to the
women of the house and to stewards, while the
master, pressed by ambition, or quite as often
by the driving necessity of getting money, was
fighting in Wales or Scotland, or was looking for
plunder in France, or for place at court. For three
generations the lands of the Pastons in Norfolk
were managed by the capable wives of absentee landlords&mdash;of
the judge who must have spent most of
his time in London or on circuit; of his son the
sharp London lawyer; and of his grandson, Sir John,
the gay young soldier who hovered between London
and Calais, and whose only care for his property was
to press anxiously for its rents. The story of
the Plumpton family was much the same. One
of the Plumptons spent his last years and died in
France; and no sooner did the young Sir William
reach his majority in 1426, than he also left his
Yorkshire estates and set off to join the French
campaign.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>On the noble class too fell the heavy consequences
of the rebellions and civil wars of which they were the
main supporters. If the lord died in battle his estates
might pass to a minor; if he died on the scaffold
they passed to the crown; or long imprisonment
might thwart his best laid plans for strengthening
his hold over his boroughs. The young Lord Maurice
of Berkeley, for instance, was drawn into rebellion
against Edward the Second, and died in prison four
and a half years later. During the whole time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
he held his estates he was only in freedom for four
months; and his eldest son, who was imprisoned
with him, was not set at liberty till some months
after his father’s death.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Meanwhile the towns
were always quick to make their profit in such times
of disturbance and revolution, as for example when
the Earl of Devonshire was attainted by Edward
the Fourth after the battle of Towton for his support
of the Lancastrian cause, and the citizens of Exeter
seized so favourable an opportunity to claim the
restitution of a suburb stretching down to the riverside
which the earls had held to strengthen their hold
on the navigation of the Exe.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the lord’s position made more hopeful by
the furious feuds between noble and noble which
distracted the provinces in the fifteenth century,
and the incessant lawsuits by which the landowners
sought to mend their fortunes. In 1463 James
Lord of Berkeley made an agreement with the
Countess of Shrewsbury that they would have no
more battles at law; for he was then sixty-nine, and
she fifty-two, and neither of them since their ages
of discretion had “enjoyed any three months of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
freedom from lawsuits.”<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Nor did they wage their
fight in the law-courts only, but carried on an open war
by which Gloucestershire had been distracted since
1421, and which proved one of the most deadly of
the many provincial conflicts of the fifteenth century.
Appeased at intervals to break out again with
renewed force, and with the usual incidents of hangings
and finings and imprisonments and ransomings,
it finally culminated in 1470 in a pitched battle on
Nibley Green, where the Berkeleys triumphantly
maintained their cause at the head of about 1,000
fighting men, and Lord Lisle, the son of Lady Shrewsbury,
who led the enemy’s army, was killed. To
country folk and traders this feud of the nobles
carried with it, we are told, “the ill-effects and destructions
of a petty war, wherein the borough
town of Berkeley, for her part, saw the burning
and prostration of many of her ancient houses, as
her old rent which till that time was £22 by the
year and upwards, and by those devastations brought
down to £11 and under, where it sticketh to this day,
without recovery of her ancient lustre or greatness.”<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
Such a strife was by no means singular or without
parallel, and the histories of Norfolk, Yorkshire,
Derbyshire, or Lancashire have their records of
similar outrages. Exeter was thrown into alarm
by a great fight on Clistheath in 1453 between
the Earl of Devon and Lord William Bonvil where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
many persons were grievously wounded and much
hurt done: “the occasion whereof was about a dog;
but great displeasure thereby came to the city, where
presently after the fight the Lord Bonvil sheltered
himself, which the Earl took amiss, thinking it had
been so done by the city in some displeasure to himself.”<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
The mere instinct of self-protection naturally
drove the towns to detach their interests from nobles
whose alliance brought disaster and ruin to simple
traders, and in every borough statute after statute
forbidding the inhabitants to wear the “livery”<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> of
any lord whatever, testified to the determination of
the towns to cut off from the great people of the
country round every possibility of stirring up faction
within their borders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>But if boroughs in the ownership of a private
lord might secure advantages through his poverty,
his misfortune, or his weakness, their position was
one of essential inferiority as compared with towns
on the public demesne.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> In the story of Liverpool
we have a curious illustration of the fortunes of a
borough whose lot it was to fall at one time into the
charge of the state, and at another to be thrown into
the hands of a noble&mdash;and whose vicissitudes at
last left it in a sort of indeterminate condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
where it owed a deferential obedience to patrons
or masters on every side.</p>

<p>Liverpool, which had been granted by Henry the
Second to the constable of Lancaster Castle, was
resumed in 1207 by John, who granted it a charter
of trading privileges. A new charter of Henry the
Third, in 1229, gave it a guild merchant and hanse,
with freedom from toll, and the rights of a free
borough; and on the very next day after this grant
Henry gave the lease of the fee-farm to the burgesses
for four years at £10 a year.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The true foundations
of municipal independence were thus laid. The
town had its common seal; one of its two bailiffs
was apparently elected by the people, and charged
with the collecting of tolls for the ferm; and the busy
trade with Ireland at that time, and the later advantage
of a secure place of embarkation for troops,
which became very important as the harbour of
Chester silted up, promised prosperity. In the same
year, however, the town was granted away by the
King to the Earl of Chester, then passed in 1232 to
the Earl of Derby; and in 1266 was given to Edmund
Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, and under the Lords
of Lancaster Liverpool remained till a century later,
when in 1361 it passed by marriage to John of
Gaunt.</p>

<p>All hope of freedom for Liverpool died away under
its new lords. The grant of the ferm was not renewed
for over a hundred years; and at an enquiry
of “Quo Warranto” in 1292 under Edward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
First “certain men of the Borough of Liverpool
came for the commonalty, and say that they have
not at present a bailiff of themselves, but have been
accustomed to have, until Edmund the King’s
brother impeded them, and permits them not to
have a free borough.” Wherefore they claim only
“that they may be quit of common fines and
amercements of the county, &amp;c., and of toll, stallage,
&amp;c., through the whole kingdom,” for “as to the
other liberties” which they used to have “the aforesaid
Edmund now has them.” They quote charters,
to show that their ancient liberties had been held
direct from the crown, and the court decided that
“Edmund hath usurped and occupied the aforesaid
liberties,” and ordered him to appear before it; but
no action seems to have been taken against him,
and for forty years he and his successors went
on themselves collecting the tolls.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> At last in
1356 the lord Henry allowed the townsmen to
elect a mayor every year, and the next year the
first Duke of Lancaster (father-in-law of John of
Gaunt) leased the ferm to the mayor and others to
hold for the burgesses for ten years,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> and Liverpool
was thus restored to the same position in which the
King had put it a hundred and thirty years earlier.
But even now its limited privileges rested simply on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the will and caprice of the lord; he might give the
lease of the ferm with the right of collecting tolls for
the rent to the mayor, or an ex-mayor, or whomever
he would; he might grant it for a year, or for ten
years, or he might take it all back into his own hands.
As a matter of fact questions of convenience and profit
seem to have made it advisable to leave the collections
of taxes mainly with the town officers. When
John of Gaunt granted his lease, at the request
of the “honest and discreet men of the burgesses”
the articles were embodied in a patent “to ourselves,
to the mayor, and to the bailiffs,”<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and in his time
the lease was commonly granted for ten years.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>However some of the evils of such a system
might be mitigated by the prudence of rulers bent
on securing the utmost possible profits from their
subjects, there was no real guarantee of freedom
or security to the people. But when at the death
of John of Gaunt in 1399, the Duchy of Lancaster
was united to the crown, there was a new gleam
of hope. The ferm of Liverpool, like that of Leicester,
was now again paid to the King; an effort seems
to have been made to abolish the old uncertain<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
system, and in 1421 Henry V. granted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
fee-farm for one year to the corporation, while an
inquiry was held as to the value of the property
and the terms of its tenure since the time of John
of Gaunt. The King’s death however stopped the
proceedings, and the rising fortunes of the town
were extinguished by the two great families who
were from this time definitely settled down on it.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>For Liverpool was now hemmed in between two rival
fortresses. Sir John Stanley with an army of followers
was encamped in a great square embattled fort, with
subordinate towers and buildings forming three sides
of a quadrangle, the whole planted on the river edge,
and commanding both the town and the Mersey,
where the Stanleys’ ships were moored, and whence
they set sail for their new kingdom, the Isle of Man.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
Sir Richard Molyneux, as hereditary Constable, held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the King’s castle a little further along the river,
with its area of fifty square acres defended by four
towers, and surrounded by a fosse thirty yards wide,
much of which was cut in the solid rock.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> When a
quarrel broke out in 1424 between the lords of these
rival fortresses, Stanley collected a multitude of
people in the town to the number of 2,000 or more,
for he declared that Sir Richard Molyneux “will come
hither with great congregations, riots, and great
multitude of people to slay and beat the said Thomas
(Stanley), his men and his servants, the which he
would withstand if he might.” On the other hand
Sir Richard had gathered his forces near the West
Derby fen, “and there on a mow within the said
town we saw the said Sir Richard with great congregations,
rout and multitude to the number of
1,000 men and more, arrayed in manner as to go to
battle, and coming in fast towards Liverpool town.” A
pitched battle was only prevented by the sheriff of
the county, who hastened to the rescue at the head
of his forces, and succeeded in seizing first Stanley
in his tower, and then Molyneux as he rode towards
the town.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Such scenes of riot and disorder were fatal to the
prosperity and municipal hopes of Liverpool; but
there was no escape from their unwelcome patrons.
Both the great houses fought for York; and in return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Edward the Fourth granted to Stanley the borough of
Liverpool and other estates formerly belonging to the
Duchy of Lancaster; while Molyneux was made chief
forester of West Derby, steward of West Derby and
Salford, and constable of Liverpool castle. Richard
the Third again gave to the Stanleys large grants in
Lancashire, and confirmed the Molyneux people in
their offices,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> and Henry the Seventh favoured their
claims. The lords were great and important people in
those days, and the little town of no account. Its independence
died away, and the troubles of the ferm
revived in their old bad form. The question of the
lease was never settled, but in any case it passed out of
the hands of the corporation. From 1495 it was for
many years granted to David ap Griffith, who when
he became mayor in 1502 had it renewed to him.
Henry the Eighth leased it in 1525 and 1529 to his
widow and son-in-law for terms which were to expire
in 1566. In 1537, however, it was let to Thomas
Holcraft, who sublet it to Sir William Molyneux.
The mayor and corporation under Edward the Sixth
declared the authority of the Molyneux family to be
illegal, and claimed under the old lease granted to
Griffith. For many years they fought obstinately
in the case, holding perhaps that the house of
their old mayor more nearly represented the town
and its interests than the house of Molyneux; and
one of them was thrown into prison for his resistance
under Mary.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The ferm was not finally granted to
the corporation till 1672; and Liverpool was for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
couple of centuries so sorely tried by the necessity
of keeping well with the two great families that
overawed it as well as with the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> whether in the collecting of its
scanty taxes or the choosing of its burghers for
Parliament, that the history of its civic developement
long remained of no importance.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Battle for Freedom</span></p>

<p class="pch">(3) <i>Towns on Church Estates</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> towns on ecclesiastical estates form a distinct
group, whose lot was materially different from
boroughs on ancient demesne or on feudal lands. All
lay property was subject only to laws and customs
which had been ultimately determined by the necessities
of social or political expediency, and which,
dealing with secular possessions for secular purposes,
were capable of being unmade as they had been made.
But the towns which were reckoned among ecclesiastical
estates lay under the special conditions
that governed those estates, where religious and
supernatural influences had been forced into the
service of material wealth, and the attempt was made
by spiritual authority to fix fluctuating political conditions
into perpetual immutability. Prelates of the
Church professed to rule with a double title, not
only as feudal lords of the soil, but as guardians
of the patrimony of S. Peter, holding property in
trust for a great spiritual corporation, and exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
an authority maintained by formidable sanctions. If
the watchwords of property are always impressive,
among lay folk they are still open, under sufficiently
strong pressure, to reasonable discussion; and it is
admitted that temporal rights may be plausibly exchanged
for others more expedient, or may be fairly
bartered away as a means of buying a continued and
secure existence. The Church, however, by a fruitful
confusion of the terms ecclesiastical and religious,
assumed to hold property by another tenure than
any temporal owner; girt round about by tremendous
safeguards to which the lay world could not aspire,
and leaning on supernatural support for deliverance
from all perils, it could the better refuse to discuss
bargains suggested by mere political expediency.</p>

<p>The difficulty of reconciling this assumption of
permanent and indivisible supremacy with the actual
facts of life became very apparent with the passage of
the centuries, when from a variety of causes it was
no longer possible for the clerical order to maintain
the place it had once held as the advanced guard
of industry and learning, and its tendency was to
sink into the position of a parasite class, producing
nothing itself, but clinging to the means of wealth
developed by the labour of a subject people. With
the wisdom born of experience the Church was ready
to give to its tenants all trading privileges, and any
liberties that directly made for the accumulation of
wealth;<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> but the flow of its liberality was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
dried up when townspeople proposed to add political
freedom to material gain, nor was it likely to be
quickened again by the crude simplicity with which
the common folk resolved the question of the lordship
of canons and monks.</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“Unneth (scarcely) might they matins say,<br />
For counting and court holding;”<br />
<span class="ls1 elarge">······</span></p>
<p class="ppq4">“Saint Benet made never none of them<br />
To have lordship of man nor town.”<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The rising municipalities on the other hand, even
if they had a history but a century or two old, were
endowed with all the young and vigorous forces of
the modern world; nor is there a single instance of a
town where a lively trade went hand in hand with a
subservient spirit, or where a temper of unconquerable
audacity in commercial enterprise did not throw
its exuberant force into the region of government and
politics. With all their abounding energy, however,
burghers had still to discover that freedom might
be won anywhere save at the hands of an ecclesiastical
lord. If Norwich received from the bounty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>Kings one privilege after another in quick succession
till its emancipation was complete, its neighbour
Lynn, equally wealthy and enterprising, but subject
to the Bishop of Norwich, was fighting in 1520
to secure just such control of its local courts as
Norwich had won for the asking three hundred years
before. The royal borough of Sandwich had been
allowed to elect its mayor and govern itself for
centuries, while Romney, also one of the Cinque
Ports but one which happened to be owned by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, did not gain the right
to choose its own mayor till the time of Elizabeth,
and was meanwhile ruled by any one of the
archbishop’s squires or servants whom he might
send as its bailiff, and forced to adopt any expedient
by which while under the forms of bondage it
might win the practice of freedom. A dozen generations
of Nottingham burghers had been ordering
their own market, taking the rents of their butcheries
and fish stalls and storage rooms, supervising
their wool traders and mercers, and admitting new
burgesses to their company by common consent,
while the men of Reading were still trying in vain
every means by which they might win like privileges
from the abbot who owned the town. Everywhere
the same story is repeated, with varying incidents
of passion and violence. The struggle sometimes
lasted through centuries: in other cases it
was brought to an early close. Some boroughs won
a moderate success, while others wasted their labour
and their treasure for small reward. In one place
ruin settles down on the town, in another gleams of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
temporary success kindle new hopes, in a third the
dogged fight goes on with monotonous persistence;
but everywhere anger and vengeance wait for the day
of retaliation, when monastery and priory should be
levelled to the ground.</p>

<p>I. There was a distinct difference in the lot of
towns under the control of a bishop, and others which
were subject to a convent. Burghers who owed
allegiance to a bishop had to do with a master whose
wealth, whose influence, whose political position,
whose training, made him a far more formidable
opponent than any secular lord. On the other
hand he probably lived at some distance from the
borough, and, charged as he was with the administration
of his bishopric and the estates of the see,
besides all the business of a great court official
occupied in weighty matters of state, he had but
limited attention to give to its affairs. As the see
passed from hand to hand, a resolute fight with an
over-ambitious borough which was begun by one
bishop might die away under the feebler rule, the
indifference, or the wiser judgement of his successor.
In the case therefore of towns on episcopal estates, if
the struggle was arduous and costly, still its issue
was not irrevocably determined beforehand, and the
burghers might hope for at least partial victory.
But the emancipation of the townsmen was long
deferred, and in the fifteenth century there were
boroughs where the bishop’s hand still pressed
heavily on the inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the greatest trading towns in England gives
such a record of ceaseless contention carried on
to win rights which had been peacefully granted
long before to every prosperous borough on the
royal demesne. The Bishop of Norwich had been
lord of Lynn since its earliest history.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> It is true
that about 1100 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, one Bishop Herbert made a
grant of the Church of S. Margaret and the little
borough that lay around it&mdash;between Millfleet and
Purfleet&mdash;to the monks of Norwich. But the land
beyond these boundaries still belonged to the see.
Lying as it did at the mouth of the Ouse, and
forming the only outlet for the trade of seven shires,
Lynn was destined to be one of the great commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
ports of the east coast, and the bishops proved good
stewards of their property. As population outgrew
the Lynn of older days, with its little market shut
in between the Guildhall and S. Margaret’s where
the booths then as now leaned against the walls of
the parish church, and its tangle of narrow lanes
leading to the river side, houses began to reach out
over the desolate swamp that stretched to the north
along the river side. Under the energetic rule of the
prelates the sea which ebbed and flowed over the
marsh was driven back, and a great wall raised
against it, 340 feet long and nine feet thick at the
base; while another stone wall ran along the eastern
side to protect the town from enemies who might
approach it by land. In the second half of the twelfth
century the “Bishop’s Lynn” rose on the newly won
land along the river bank, with its great market-place,
its church, its Jewry, its merchant houses; and
soon in the thick of the busiest quarter by the
wharves appeared the “stone house” of the bishop
himself, looking closely out on the “strangers’
ships” that made their way along the Ouse, laden
with provisions and merchandise.</p>

<p>Lynn was now in a fair way to become the
Liverpool of mediæval times. Under King John its
prudent bishop obtained for the town charters
granting it all the liberties and privileges of a free
borough, saving the rights of its lords;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> and then
at once proceeded by a bargain with the convent at
Norwich to win back for the see the whole of the lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
property in the old borough, leaving to the monks
only the churches and spiritual rights. Once more
sole master of the town, his supremacy was only
troubled by the lords of Castle Rising who, by virtue
of a grant from William Rufus, claimed half the
profits of the tolbooth and duties of the port, while
the bishop had the other half. In 1240 however an
exact agreement was drawn up between prelate and
baron as to their respective rights; and the bailiffs
of both powers maintained a somewhat boisterous
jurisdiction over the waters of Lynn,<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> collected their
share of dues paid by the town traders on cargoes
of herrings, or on the wood, skins, and wine they
imported from foreign parts, and in their own way
made distresses for customs, plaints, and so forth.
Thus Robert of Montault, in the time of Edward the
Second, set up a court under his own bailiff at one of
the bridges, and caused the merchants “rowing and
flowing to the said town of Lynn with their ships
and boats, laden as well with men as with merchandise,”
to be summoned, distrained, and harassed,
“both by menacing them with hurling of stones
that they come to land and tarry, and by extorting
heavy fines from them,” till at last in despair the
traders gave up their business, and sold all their
ships and boats. And when the exasperated burghers
in their turn set upon these alien officers in 1317
and threw Robert himself into prison,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> this outbreak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
only brought upon them new calamities,
for they were condemned by the King’s judges to
make atonement for their crime by paying to the
offended lord within the next six or seven years a
fine of four thousand pounds; which was practically
equal to the confiscation of the whole of the municipal
expenditure for about thirty years. Soon after
this, however, the rights of the lords of Rising were
sold to the Queen Dowager Isabella and passed
through her to Edward the Third; so the rough
and ready methods of their bailiffs came to an end.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>The power of the bishop on the other hand was
still untouched. He held the Hall Court through his
steward; and held further the Court Leet and view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of frankpledge; and owned the Tolbooth Court.
There was indeed a mayor,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> but his authority was
small, for the bishop who had been eager to grant
his burghers the privileges of trade<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> was less eager
to see them set up any real self-government. Owing
his post to the bishop’s approval and nomination, if
the mayor failed in obedience or respect his place
might be at once forfeited. His power of levying
taxes was limited and subject to his lord’s
control, nor could he make distress for sums levied
on the commonalty. He was not charged with the
custody or the defence of the town; it was the bishop
who had command of the town gates, who could
order them to be shut at his own will, and with a
following of men-at-arms could enforce the order.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
What was far more important, the bishop on the
plea of protecting the poor from tyranny had withdrawn
from him the power of compelling inhabitants
to take up the franchise, and by thus establishing in
the borough a population dependent on himself had
permanently divided its forces.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>As in other towns, however, so here the Guild
Merchant proved itself a most powerful organization
for the winning of local independence.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Lynn was
already in the thirteenth century becoming one of
the richest towns in the country, and the mayor
was supported by a Guild as masterful and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
wealthy as any in England. When once the question
was raised whether he or the bishop was really to
command within its gates, two equally matched and
formidable forces were brought into play; and a war
of two hundred years was conducted on either side
with violence and craft, and remained of doubtful
issue to the last. The bishop narrowly watched every
effort made by the mayor to enlarge his powers or
exalt his state; and the mayor was no less jealous of
the pretensions of his lord. In the course of many
experiments in the making of constitutions for its
government, Lynn was again and again torn with disputes,
and harassed by the difficulties of rightly
adjusting the powers of its various classes; and in
every constitutional struggle the bishop interfered
anew, and often almost dictated the final settlement.
The burghers treated him as occasion served. Constant
gifts were offered to soften his heart. A pipe of red
wine, a vessel of Rhine wine, portions of oats with a
sturgeon, pike and tenches, formed one of these peace
offerings;<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> at another time it would be a costly gift of
wax. But what they gave with one hand they were
ready to take away with the other; and when chance
happily favoured them appropriated without scruple a
house, 100 acres of land and twenty acres of pasturage
which the bishop held in right of his church of Holy
Trinity at Norwich.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> As disputes grew hot, now
over one point, now over another, prelate and town
alike called the king’s authority to their aid. If a
sea-wall was washed away by a high tide, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
burghers would cry to the Privy Council to compel the
bishop to rebuild it;<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> or they would demand justice
against him on the plea that he had usurped their
own officers’ right to hold the Leet Court and the
Tolbooth Court. The decision of the crown was given
sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other; or
the sovereign might for a time take the disputed
authority into his own hands. But it was inevitable
that the final gain should fall to the king,
whose authority was strengthened by every appeal
to his supreme jurisdiction; while lesser profits came
to the court by the way&mdash;gifts to high officials and
great people, and to the royal judges when they
came to hold their assizes in the Guild Hall, and the
town lavished its treasures in costly dinners and
varied wines and presents to them and to their
clerks.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the fourteenth century we
can trace the progress of the long strife as the town
gradually perfected its municipal organization. First
came the necessary financial precautions. In 1305
the Guild established itself more firmly by a charter
which secured to it all its lands and tenements;
and the mayor obtained power to distrain for sums
levied on the commonalty.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Then at an assembly
held in the Guildhall in 1314 authority was given to
twenty-six persons to elect twelve of the more
sufficient of the town to make provision for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
business touching the community in the King’s
parliament and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> But the real struggle
seems to have begun about 1327 when much money
was spent on lawyers, negotiations with the bishop,
and a new charter, and the business was still going
on in 1330 with more counsels’ fees and messengers
to London. Finally in 1335 the town bought a new
charter from the king at a cost of £55 and a multitude
of gifts to king and queen and bishop.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> In this year
or the next it obtained, among other things, the right
to have all wills that affected property in the town
proved in the Guild Hall before the mayor and burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
The bishop seems to have found means
of defeating the burghers’ intention in this particular
claim; but there still remained the one important
question which lay behind all minor struggles&mdash;that
of the administration of justice in the town&mdash;the
question whether it was the mayor or an ecclesiastical
officer who should preside in the courts, and whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
their profits, fines, and forfeitures should go to enrich
the treasury of the bishop or of the municipality.
The mayor held a court in the Guild Hall twice a
week, and had jurisdiction over all transgressions and
debts arising by water between the limits of S.
Edmondness and Staple Weyre,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> and he seems now
further to have laid claim to the view of frankpledge
and the criminal jurisdiction of the Leet Court. The
bishop answered with a vigorous retort. In 1347
he assumed the view of frankpledge of the men of
Lynn and tenements formerly held by the corporation,
and withdrew or threatened to withdraw from
the burghers the right of electing their mayor. On
this an appeal was made to the king, who sent a royal
commission to enquire into the dispute, and meanwhile
seized with his own hand the view of frankpledge
and the lands, giving the first over for the
time to the sheriff of the county and the second to
the king’s escheator.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Possibly there was some
attempt at a compromise, but the new charter of
1343 in which the bishop confirmed the liberties
granted by his predecessors,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> even if it may have
allowed the mayor’s election, left the great question
of the courts unsolved. The burghers still debated
whether the town officers were not entitled to hold
the view of frankpledge, and the husting court, and
to have cognizance of pleas&mdash;in fact to exercise all
the more important rights now monopolized by the
bishop; and insisted on the election of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
mayor. It was in vain that Edward the Third
ordered the mayor and community under pain of
forfeiture of their liberties to alter their demeanour
and not cause prejudice and damage to the bishop;<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
and the whole matter was at last brought before the
King’s Court in 1352, when the judges decided
against the town in every question raised. In spite
of the verdict, however, there was one point on
which the people refused to submit; and the bishop
was compelled to confirm their right to elect yearly
one of themselves as mayor, though he enforced
a significant confession of subjection by requiring
that the mayor should immediately after the
election appear before himself or his steward, and
swear to maintain the rights of the church of
Norwich.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>But the burghers never yielded their consent to the
decision of the King’s justices, and at every provocation
loudly renewed their protest. When the bishop
visited Lynn in 1377, he demanded that in recognition
of his supremacy the town serjeant should carry
before him the wand tipped at both ends with
black horn, which was usually borne before the
mayor himself. For their part they were heartily
willing, answered the courteous mayor and aldermen,
but they feared that at such a flagrant breach of
their ancient customs and liberties, the commons,
“always inclinable to evil,” would certainly fall on
the bishop’s party with stones and drive them out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of the town. But the bishop roughly rebuked
the mayor and his brethren for “mecokes and
dastards,” thus fearing the vulgar sort of people, as
if it mattered to him what the common folk should
say; and set out on his ride with the rod borne before
him. He rode alone with his followers, however, for
no burghers would accompany him; and as he went the
whole people rose, and with their bows and clubs and
staves and stones broke up the brave procession, and
put the bishop and his men to flight, carrying off many
hurt and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> It seems possible that the fray
was really excited by the astute mayor and council as
a means of making a final breach between the bishop
and the common people. But their opponent was
too strong for them. The bishop carried his complaint
to the King’s Council, and “for the transgression
done to him in the town” the burgesses barely escaped
punishment by spending a sum equal perhaps to two
years of the town revenues in fines and gifts to the
king, his mother, and others who had “laboured for
the community”; besides paying £116 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for the
expenses of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, in
going to London on the business.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Seventy years
later, after a series of constitutional troubles,
the old quarrel as to rights of jurisdiction and the
use of the symbols of supreme authority broke out
anew. The mayor in 1447 got a grant from the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
allowing a sword to be carried before him<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> with the
point erect, the last and highest emblem of absolute
jurisdiction. At this outrage to his dignity the
bishop interfered promptly and resolutely, and the
next year the King had to write that in spite of his
good inclinations he must remember his coronation
oath to observe the rights of the Church, and that
the mayor must henceforth cease from having any
sword or mace borne before him. In 1461,
however, whether the town had got a new grant
from Edward, or was taking advantage of troubled
times to re-assert its claim, the common accounts
register a payment of 4<i>d.</i> for the “cleaning of the
mayor’s sword,” and 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for “crimson velvet for
the sword and for making it up.”<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> And when in 1462
the bishop came to the town with a following of sixty
armed men, and ordered the gates to be shut after
him, the attitude of the people was not to be mistaken,
“the mayor and all the commonalty of Lynn
keeping their silence” when the bishop was openly
defied in the streets by the lord of Oxenford with
his fellowship, even though “the bishop and his
squires rebuked the mayor of Lynn, and said he had
shamed both him and his town for ever, with much
other language.” So clear was the state of things
to the bishop’s sixty men-at-arms that “when we
met there bode not with him over twelve persons at
the most with his serjeant-at-arms, <i>which serjeant
was fain to lay down his mace</i>; and so at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
gates we came in we went out, and no blood drawn,
God be thanked.”<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>The incident was not one to soften passions or
conciliate rivals; but the issue of the strife as
compared with the hostilities in the last century
shows how the balance of power was shifting. The
bishop’s resources were being exhausted faster than
his pretensions; every trader in Lynn was perpetually
reminded that in Norwich, only fifty miles or
so distant, the citizens had held their own borough
court since 1194, and the higher court with view of
frankpledge since 1223. For these privileges they
themselves had waited now for three hundred years,
and only one settlement was possible. In 1473
the quarrel as to the view of frankpledge was still
going on,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> but the bishop was driven at last to a
compromise which preserved his historic claims untouched
in theory, while it handed over the real
power to the municipality. For the sake of peace
he consented in 1528 to lease to the mayor and burgesses
the yearly Leet, the Steward’s Hall Port,
and the Tolbooth Port;<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> besides various dues from
fairs and markets, with waifs and strays, and some
other rights. A ruder and more effective close was
before long put to the quarrel by the sharp methods
of the Reformation, when Bishop’s Lynn became
finally the King’s Lynn.</p>

<p>II. If boroughs attached to a bishopric were in a
difficult position, the difficulty was vastly increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
in the case of those subject to the lordship and rule
of a monastery. Towns owned by abbot or prior
were like all the rest stirred by the general zeal for
emancipation, but they were practically cut off from
any hope of true liberty. The power with which they
had to fight was invincible. Against the little lay
corporation was set a great ecclesiastical corporation,
wealthy, influential, united, persistent, immortal. All
the elements which went to make up the strength of
the town were raised in the convent to a yet higher
degree of perfection, and the struggle was prolonged,
intense, and at the best remained a drawn battle,
setting nothing beyond dispute save the animosity of
the combatants. Sometimes the defeat of the borough
in the fifteenth century was as complete as it had
been two hundred years before. Cirencester which
had won extended privileges from Henry the Fourth
in return for political services in his time of difficulty,
was utterly beaten at last,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> and fell back under the
control of the Abbey as completely as St. Alban’s had
done in earlier times.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> In other cases the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
was more energetic and sustained, and some slight
measure of success was its reward.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>As in the case of towns on feudal estates, any
borough that possessed traditions of freedom handed
down from a state of larger liberties might have
some hope of ultimate success, but otherwise rebellion
could only issue in defeat so final and decisive as to
leave no further room for argument. Under the impulse
of the popular movement which seems to have
agitated many towns after the rising that took place
in the days of Simon de Montfort, the men of S.
Edmundsbury kept up for about seventy years a
desperate struggle with the abbot who ruled them.
For in 1264 it happened that “the younger and less
discreet” of the town organized a conspiracy under
colour of a Guild called “the Guild of Young Men,”
and despising altogether the ancient horn of the
community set up a new common horn of their own.
Three hundred and more of these hopeful conspirators,
known by the name of “bachelors,” having bound
themselves to obey no bailiff save the aldermen and
bailiffs of their own Guild, to answer to the sound
of their new common horn instead of the old moot
horn, and to count all who did not join them as public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
enemies,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> soon found themselves engaged in riotings
and in violently resisting the abbot from behind
closed gates. On the abbot’s appeal to the Crown,
however, the town grew frightened; the Guild was
annihilated by the help of the more prudent sort, and
the insurrection suppressed.</p>

<p>In less than thirty years, however, the burghers
were renewing the memory of their old offences&mdash;forcing
townsmen against their will to go to the hall
of the Guild, and take an oath of allegiance to it;
levying tolls and taxes, distraining on merchants who
sold in the abbot’s market to extort money from
them; hindering the execution of justice on merchants
suspected of selling goods outside that market; and
refusing to allow any member of the guild to bring
a plea in the abbot’s court against any other brother
of the guild: while the abbot on his side asserted
his right to choose the alderman of the town and to
appoint the keepers of the gates. In spite of a compromise
made before the king’s judges sent the next
year to enquire into the case, the same charges were
again brought against the men of Bury before a royal
commission of judges in 1304. The accused confessed
that the abbot was lord of the whole town and its
courts, but they still urged a claim to be free burgesses
and to have an alderman, and a Merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Guild with certain rights of justice belonging to it
and with an elaborate code of procedure, and asserted
their right to hold meetings for the common profit
of the burgesses, and to levy taxes from men trading
in the town. All this the abbot denied, whether the
right to a Merchant Guild, or pleas belonging to it,
or a community, or a common seal, or a mayor;
according to him the townsfolk only had a right to a
drinking feast, which they maliciously turned into an
illegal convention, and if they took any fines it was
against the merchant law and the King’s peace. The
case was given for the abbot. The leaders were fined
and put in jail, some of them escaping by payments
while others through poverty lay in prison a month.</p>

<p>Once more, however, the burghers took heart, and
in 1327 broke into the abbey and forced the abbot
to concede to them a community, a common seal, a
Guild merchant, and custody of their gates, with other
liberties. But their triumph was short; utterly defeated
by the forces of abbot and king, they were
forced in the concord of 1332 to renounce for ever
the claim to a community;<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> and when after the
Peasant Revolt there was much general begging
for pardon, the men of S. Edmundsbury, who were
ordered to sue for their pardons specially, had to
find surety not only to the King but to their lord
the abbot.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>If S. Edmundsbury was one of the most unfortunate
ecclesiastical towns Reading was perhaps the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
fortunate. For Reading was originally a borough
on royal demesne, which was granted by Henry the
First to the new monastery founded by him.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> From
this time the town lay absolutely in the control of the
abbot. He owned all its streams, from which the
inhabitants had “chiefly their water to brew, bake,
and dress their meat.”<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The mills were in his hands;
he did as he chose with the market, controlled
the trade, and had the entire supervision of the
cloth manufacture. He appointed the Warden of
the Guild or mayor, and the various town officers;
and claimed a decisive voice in the admitting of new
burgesses or members of the Guild, while from every
burgher’s son who entered the Guild he claimed a
tax of 4<i>s.</i>, and from every stranger one-half of the
fine paid as entrance fee&mdash;the sum of the fine being
fixed in presence of a monk who might raise
objections so long as he was not overborne by the
joint voices of six legal men of the Guild. Every
burgher in the Guild had further to pay to him a
yearly tax of <i>chepin gavell</i> for the right of buying
or selling in the town.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> For any breach of the law
fines were gathered in to increase his hoard, since all
the administration of justice lay in his hands. Before
the abbot alone the emblems of supreme authority
might be borne, and the mayor when he went in
state was only allowed to have two tipped staves
carried before him by the abbot’s bailiffs.</p>

<p>From the time of Henry the Third there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
unceasing war between the townsmen and their
lord. Violent dissensions broke out in 1243, when the
burghers “lay in wait day and night for the abbot’s
bailiffs,” and “hindered them from performing their
duties,” till order was restored by a precept from
the King.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The townsfolk were appeased by
the grant of certain trading privileges; but ten
years later the quarrel broke out again. The
abbot, as they maintained before the King’s Court
at Westminster, had taken away their Guild, summoned
them to another place than their own Guild
Hall to answer pleas, changed the site of their
market, and forced them to render unwonted services.
An agreement was drawn up before the judges, by
which the burghers won the right to hold their
corn market in its accustomed place, to own their
common Guild Hall, with a few tenements that
belonged to it, and a field called Portmanbrok (the
rent of which was set apart for the salary of the
mayor), and to maintain their Guild merchant as of
old. On the other hand the townspeople conceded that
it was the abbot’s right to select the Warden of the
Guild from among the guildsmen, and require him
to take oath of fidelity to himself as well as to the
burgesses. The abbot might tallage the town at
certain times, and his bailiffs were still to administer
justice, and might at any time claim the keys of the
Guild Hall, sit there to hold pleas, carry off all
profits to the abbot’s treasury, and fine the burgesses
any sum which it was in their power to pay. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
it was admitted that the meadow beyond the Portmanbrok
belonged to the lord.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>After an arrangement which left to the abbot all
the weighty matters of government, the control of
the burghers’ trade and a charge on their profits,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
it was no wonder that before a hundred years were
over the inhabitants of Reading, restless and discontented,
were again battling for larger privileges.
In 1351 the mayor and commonalty refused
obedience to a constable appointed by the abbot’s
steward, claiming for themselves the right to choose
the constables, and present them to take their
oaths before the king’s justices and the justices of
the peace instead of before the abbot. At the same
time they raised various fundamental questions
as to their rights, just as Lynn was doing almost
in the very same year. They asked whether the
town was not a royal borough and therefore in no
way dependent on the abbey; whether the townsmen
had not therefore a right to elect their own mayor; and
whether that mayor ought not to exercise jurisdiction
over the burgesses and commonalty “according to
the custom of the borough and Guild”&mdash;questions
which one and all afforded fair subjects of dispute
for the next hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The burghers henceforth gave the abbot no rest.
In the long quarrel the Merchant Guild became the
real centre of the common activity, just as it did
wherever a town subject to a lord temporal or
spiritual failed to win independent jurisdiction of its
own.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> For if there were free boroughs where the
mayor, with his council and the common assembly of
the burghers in which the whole conduct of government
was centred, were in name and fact the accepted
constitutional authorities; on the other hand in dependent
towns where political freedom was still incomplete
the Merchant Guild appears as ostensibly
the only means by which the will of the community
could find expression; as men recognized in it
the one society in whose disciplined ranks they
might be enrolled to fight for the liberties they
claimed, its organization was held to be the most important
of their privileges and the truest symbol of
their common life; and it necessarily became the
bond of fellowship, the pledge of future freedom,
the school of political energies.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> In such towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
therefore the Merchant Guild had a vitality and a
persistent continuity of life which was unknown
elsewhere, and was often preserved in full vigour
two or three centuries after it had perhaps suffered
decay or transformation elsewhere.</p>

<p>This was the case in Reading. The burghers fell
back on the Guild as the one authorized mode of
association for public purposes, and in its “morghespeche,”
or “morning talks,” the leading townsfolk
discussed how the independence of the borough
might be advanced. Successive mayors of the Guild,
though still to all appearance appointed as officers of
the abbot, became really the representatives of the
town, identified themselves absolutely with its interests,
and readily led their fellow citizens in revolt
against the convent. In 1378 the burghers paid about
£5 for a new charter; and twice sent the mayor to
London to assert their privileges, and to insist that
the convent should be forced to bear a just share of
the burden of taxation, and pay a part of the tenth
demanded by the King. The messengers were lavish
with their gifts to judges and officers and lawyers who
might befriend them, eels and pike, perches and salmon
and capons; and succeeded so well that the town
charters were confirmed in 1400, in 1418, and in 1427.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
In 1391 the burghers carried the dispute about the
appointment of constables to the king’s judges at
Westminster; and seem to have succeeded in this
matter too, for in 1417 the mayor elected the constables
in the Guild Hall, and the justices of the peace
admitted them to office. About 1420 a Guild Hall
was built close to the Hallowed Brook, though the
burghers complained of being “so disturbed with
beating of battle-dores” by the women washing in
the brook that they could scarcely hold their courts
or do any public business.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> They made payments for
the clock house, and set up a bell for the community,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
and appointed a permanent salary for the mayor of
five marks, to be paid from the Common Chest
instead of the uncertain rent of the Portmanbrok.
But when they went on to build a new “Outbutchery,”
and buy “smiting stocks” for butchers not
living in the town, the abbot at once saw an attempt
to limit his own market profits which he immediately
resented, denying the burghers’ right to hold
their new out-butchery or receive rents from it.
They on their side protested that their Guild was
a body corporate, having a Common Hall, a seal,
and the right of possessing common property; that
they held also a wharf, a common beam or weighing-machine,
and the stocks and shambles; that they
had been granted freedom from toll throughout
the kingdom; that they returned two burgesses to
Parliament; and were freed from shire and hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
courts; and finally they asserted, to sum up all the
rest, that they had held of the King long before
the monastery was founded.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> In 1431 lawyers were
appointed to search the evidences in the Common
Chest as to agreements between the town and the
abbot. At the same time a Register of the Acts of
the mayor and burgesses was begun, and continued
year after year without break. In 1436 and 1439
payments were made for the writing out of certain
articles as to the privileges of the town; and counsel
were again employed to look over the evidences in
1441.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Throughout these years the mayor and officers were
constantly at Maidenhead, London, or Canterbury,
holding consultations about legal business with
Lyttleton and the most famous lawyers. They succeeded
in buying a charter for their Guild Hall with
sums contributed by rich citizens; and gratefully
adorned the building with a picture of the King. The
mayor of the guild became more and more the representative
of the burghers’ hopes, and his greatness the
symbol of their triumph. They had not only raised
his salary in 1459 to ten nobles,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> but like their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
brethren at Lynn they got permission from Henry
the Sixth to have a mace carried before him; and in
1459 the mace was actually bought.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> At this extravagance,
however, the abbot made a firm stand, and
Henry had to send a letter to the Mayor of Reading,
just as he had done eleven years before to the mayor
of Lynn, ordering that this privilege should remain
with the abbot alone as the token of his supremacy.
But the mayor possibly gained his point a little
later, for in 1487 he was allowed two Mace-serjeants,
so it would seem that at least his tipped staves were
now borne by his own servants.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> He secured too for
himself and for the burgesses exemption from serving
on juries; and in the same year assumed supervision
of the cloth trade. In 1480 the burgesses had done
away with individual payments of the “chepin gavell”
tax to the abbot, by ordering that it should be
given from the Town Chest; and in 1486 a citizen
bequeathed property for its payment, so that the
townsmen were henceforth freed from all personal
difficulties in this matter.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>Either the question of the cloth-market or that of
the mace-serjeants brought the battle to a climax.
The abbot absolutely refused to appoint any “master
of the guild, otherwise called mayor,” and took upon
himself to admit such people as he chose to the
office of constable.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> The guild retorted by choosing a
mayor for themselves, who nominated his own officers
to keep order, while all alike in this emergency gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
their services freely, for in 1493 “nothing was paid to
the mayor, because neither he nor any one else charged
anything on the office.”<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> In the case of the lesser
offices the burghers held their own, and when in 1499
the abbot appointed two constables, the mayor thrust
them out of their places.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>But the triumph of the people was short-lived,
for in the long run they proved powerless against
the great spiritual corporation which ruled over them.
In the very next year, 1500, the inhabitants were
utterly defeated as to the election of the mayor
himself; and as they still protested, there was once
more an appeal eight years later to the judgment of
the King’s Court. The verdict of the judges threw
back the whole question almost to the very point
where it had stood centuries before at the time of the
earlier appeal in 1254, and the brethren of the Guild
were declared of ancient time to have had no other
right than the power to present from among themselves
three persons, of whom the abbot should
choose one as mayor. The two constables, and the
ten wardmen of the five wards, might be elected by
the mayor and commonalty, but they must be sworn
in before the abbot. According to ancient custom the
name of any proposed burgess must be given to the
abbot fourteen days before his election, and a monk
must be present for the assessing of his fine of forty
shillings, half of which went to the abbot; an alien’s
fine might be determined by six burgesses, and if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
affirmed on oath that the fine was reasonable the
abbot was bound to accept it. The question of the
out-butchery still remained undecided; but the dispute
as to the cloth-trade was settled by a compromise.
As in the case of the mayor, the town was to
choose three men and present them to the abbot,
who should then appoint one of the three to be the
keeper of the seal for sealing the cloth.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>So closed for the moment the long struggle of two
hundred and fifty years&mdash;a struggle whose gain was
small in comparison with all the cost and labour,
the civic enthusiasm, the learning and ability which
had been lavished on it. The easy passage to freedom
by which the royal towns had travelled, the large and
regular expansion of their liberties, the liberal admission
of their right to supremacy over their own trade
and over the higher matters of law and justice, might
well kindle in the subjects of abbey and priory a
perpetual unrest, and anger deepened against their
masters as they saw themselves, in an age of universal
movement, bound to the unchanging order of the
past, and condemned to perpetual dependence under
a galling system of administration which the secular
government had abandoned three hundred years
before.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a borough had won from its lord full rights
of self-government, its battles were not yet over. The
next effort of the town authorities was to secure
complete power over all the inhabitants within
their walls, so that they might compel all alike to
submit to the town courts, and to bear their share of
burdensome duties, such as the payment of taxes, the
keeping watch and ward, the defence of the town, the
maintenance of its trade, or the enlargement of its
liberties&mdash;in fact to take their part as good citizens
in all that concerned the common weal.</p>

<p>For all towns alike, whatever were their chartered
rights, had to reckon not only with their own lord
of the manor, but with the great people, whether
king or noble or bishop or abbot, or perhaps all
of them together, who might own a part of the land
within their walls, and might all assert their various
and conflicting rights, and multiply officials of
every kind with courts and prisons and gallows,
to vindicate the lord’s authority. Thus in Warwick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in the eleventh century, when the population was
scarcely over a thousand, the King held a hundred
and thirteen houses, and various lords and prelates
owned a hundred and twelve, while there were nineteen
independent burgesses who had the right of sac
and soc. So also in the time of Edward the First
there were five gallows in Worcester and the district
immediately round the city. One belonged to the
town, another to the bishop, and a third to the
Earl of Gloucester, while two more were set up by
the abbots of Pershore and Westminster who held
property in the borough; all of which lords and
prelates had the right of hanging thieves and rioters
in this little community of about two thousand inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>A new municipality, face to face with these traditional
claims, and powerless before the customary
rights of property, could only fall back on friendly
treaties by which both sides might win advantage
from peaceable compromise. As soon as the burghers
had won chartered privileges of trade and freedom
from toll throughout the kingdom, they had something
to offer to their neighbours, and the bargaining
began. They could propose to grant protection
and a share in their privileges, and would demand
in return that the tenants of alien lords should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
contribute to their taxes and take part in public
duties, and perhaps acknowledge, in some respects at
all events, the authority of their courts. But the
progress of the negociations and their final result underwent
considerable modifications, according as the
townspeople had to deal with the constable of the
King’s castle; with some lord who held property in
the borough; or with an ecclesiastical settlement,
whether cathedral or monastery, planted within the
liberties.</p>

<p>I. The Castle Fee was a bit of the royal territory
altogether independent of the municipality. In
Bristol, for example, the castle had its own market
at its gate; and its inhabitants were exempt from
the town justice, so that if one of the tenants of the
fee committed a crime he was sent to Gloucester
thirty miles distant instead of being tried in Bristol
itself. Since the castle fee lay outside the jurisdiction
of the town, its ditches became the refuge of felons
and malefactors flying from the bailiffs, and as late as
1627 it was stated that two hundred poor persons
were dwelling within the precincts who mostly lived
by begging, besides a number of outlaws, excommunicated
people, and offenders who found them a
hiding place, and when soldiers and sailors were impressed
great multitudes of able men “fled thither
as to a place of freedom, where malefactors live in
a lawless manner.”<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> From his position as the king’s
lieutenant the governor or Constable of the Castle in
important frontier or seaport towns was a very great
official, with an authority as military commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
which gave him the right of interference in local
affairs, and whose power might easily prove a real
danger to municipal institutions.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> In Bristol, where
the mayors after their election “did fetch and take
their oath and charge at the castle gate” from the
constable as the representative of the King, he was
practically the official arbiter in any crisis of town
politics, and when a revolt of the commons broke
out in 1312 against a handful of merchants who
controlled the municipal government, the party in
power at once claimed the constable’s help against
their fellow-townsmen. Thereupon the commons assaulted
the castle and built forts against it, so that
the forces of three counties which were marched
to the rescue by their sheriffs could not quell the
riot; but the castle party finally triumphed, the insurrection
was violently put down, twelve burgesses
banished, the rule of those who had usurped privileges
claimed by the whole commonalty confirmed,
and the enemy of the Bristol burghers, Lord Maurice
of Berkeley, appointed by the King “custos of the
castle and town.”<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>It was only however in a few boroughs that exceptional
military difficulties made the post of governor
one of great or permanent authority, as for instance in
Bristol or Southampton. And even in these towns a
good understanding was before long established between
king and burghers, and powers exercised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
royal officers which impeded the free developement
of municipal life were withdrawn without jealous
alarms on the sovereign’s side, or prolonged agitation
on the part of the town. The Bristol mayors
were freed by royal charter from the necessity of
taking their oath from the constable in 1345. And in
towns such as Norwich, where military considerations
early became of comparatively little importance, the
castle tenants were made to contribute to the city
taxes in the thirteenth century, and in the course
of the next hundred years, were put unreservedly
under the control of the city authorities.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>II. There were not very many cases where a lay
lord became a formidable enemy to municipal freedom,
either from the extent of his property in a town,
or from his power of enforcing his claims. Such
disputes as did arise were settled in various ways by
purchase or friendly compact, or by gaining from
the Crown a charter which conferred such rights
of control as were necessary for discipline and order.
Boroughs on the royal demesne naturally found themselves
supported by the King in urging these demands,
but the appeal to force always lay behind the legal
settlement, and there was occasionally a serious battle
before the question of supremacy was finally decided.
A bitter fight was waged between Bristol<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
lords of Berkeley, who owned Redcliffe, and claimed
the river where they had built a quay as part of their
lordship; who had their own courts and their own
prison; who held their own markets and fair; and
who broke the Bristol weights and measures, and refused
to take the measures of assize from the mayor
even though in such matters he acted as the King’s
marshal. They fought long and fiercely for their
power, even after a royal charter in 1240 had given
the jurisdiction over Redcliffe to the mayor.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> In 1305
an energetic young lord Maurice of Berkeley to
whom his father had given Redcliffe Street tried to
assert his rights, but at the ringing of the common
bell the Bristol men assembled, broke into Maurice’s
house, took away a prisoner from him, and refused
to allow him to hold any court, or to buy and sell
any wares in Redcliffe Street. Upon this the young
lord, appearing with “great multitudes of horse and
foot,” forced the burgesses to do suit to him, and
cast those who refused into a pit, while the women
who came to help their husbands in the fray were
trodden under foot. He set free prisoners from the
Bristol gaol, assaulted Bristol burgesses at Tetbury
fair, claimed dominion over the Severn, and seized
the Bristol ships. All this did Maurice, “than whom
a more martial knight, and of a more daring spirit,
of the age of twenty-four years, the kingdom nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
scarce the Christian world then had;” and the
mayor and burgesses left King and Parliament no
rest with their petitions, telling of outrage after
outrage committed by him, till commissioners were
appointed to examine their complaints, and to Lord
Maurice the sequel of this angry business was a
fine of 1,000 marks, afterwards commuted to service
with the King’s army with ten horsemen. A few
years later moreover the Bristol men found opportunity
to avenge their bitter grudge, for when he
was taken in rebellion the mayor and the commonalty,
“out of an inveterate hatred and remembrance of
former passages,” threw into the common gaol every
man who was even suspected of having adhered to
the faction of Maurice.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Troubles again broke out
in 1331, and the mayor and burgesses gathered at
the ringing of the common bell for an assault on a
Lord Thomas of Berkeley, destroyed his tumbrill
and pillory, carried his bailiff to the Guild Hall,
and forced him to swear that he would never again
execute any judgements in the courts. The next
year however the town, “taking the advantage of
the time while the said lord was in trouble about
the murder of King Edward the Second in his castle
of Berkeley,” settled the matter for ever by an opportune
payment to the King of £40, for which the
mayor and burgesses obtained a confirmation of all
their charters, and especially that which granted
that Redcliffe Street should be within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>No sooner was the dispute finally decided than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
rancour quickly died away, and the burgesses of
Bristol settled down into the most friendly relations
with Berkeley castle. The lords of Berkeley took to
trading in wool and corn and wine, and went partners
with Bristol men in robbing carracks of Genoa as well
as in lawful traffic.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> So far had the wheel of fortune
turned that one of the lords who made a treaty of
peace with the Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury
meekly appeared before the mayor and council of
Bristol to give surety;<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> and when he went out to
fight at Nibley the Bristol merchants sent men to
his help.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> The alliance was cemented by marriage
when a Berkeley in 1475 took to wife a daughter of
the mayor of Bristol;<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> and when she died in 1517 the
mayor, the master of the Guild, the aldermen, sheriffs,
chamberlains, and wardens of Bristol, and thirty-three
crafts, followed the coffin with two hundred torches&mdash;altogether
a multitude of five or six thousand people.
A “drinking” was made by the family for the mayor
and his brethren in St. Mary’s Hall, at which they
were entertained with a first course of cakes, comfits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and ale, followed by another of marmalade, snoket,
red wine, and claret, and a third of wafers and blanch
powder, with romney and muscatel; “and I thank
God,” wrote the steward, “no plate nor spoons was
lost, yet there was twenty dozen spoons.”<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>III. Ecclesiastical corporations also nominally held
their property in the various towns by the usual
feudal tenure, just like the lay lords; and when a
borough formally stated its theoretic relations with
them both lay and spiritual lords were put on exactly
the same level. The “Customs” of Hereford show us
the ideal view of these relations as the burghers liked
to picture them. “Fees” within the walls<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> were held
by both ecclesiastical and lay lords, whose tenants
desired a share in the city privileges, and the Hereford
men classed them all together under a common description.
“There are some lords and their tenants
who are dwellers and holders of lands and tenements
within the said bounds, which they hold by a certain
service which is called ‘liberum feodum’; because
long ago they besought us that they might be of us,
and they would be rated and taxed with us, and they
are free among us concerning toll and all other
customs and services by us made, but concerning
their foreign services which they do, or ought to do,
and of old have done, their lords are not excluded
by us nor by our liberties; for we never use to
intermix ourselves with them in any things touching
those tenures, but only with those which concern us,
or their tenures which for a time hath been of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
our condition.”<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Tenants still bound to render
feudal services to their lords were not reckoned
among the true aristocracy of the freemen, who in
admitting them to a limited fellowship marked their
sense of the difference of status between the free
burgher and the man who was but half emancipated;
“and such men ought not to be called citizens or
our fellow citizens ... because they are ‘natives,’
or born in the behalf of their lords, and do hold
their tenements by foreign services and are not burgesses.”
It was only when a tenant bought a house
in the city and was in scot and lot with the citizens,
that they allowed that he “is free and of our condition;
but let him take heed to himself that he
depart not from the city to any place into the
power of his lord.”<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>But the municipality was perfectly firm in the
assertion of the authority which it had a right to
exercise over all those who were admitted to the
privileges of the common trade, and took a very decided
tone with the spiritual as well as with the
lay lords. To the Hereford burghers it was obvious
that the ecclesiastical tenants only enjoyed a share
in the town liberties by the grace of the citizens,
and in virtue of “a composition betwixt us and
them, which we for reverence to God and to the
Church our mother had granted the same unto
them; and also for divers alms to be given to
our citizens and other poor and impotent of our city
in an almshouse by the keeper of the same for ever.
And it was not our intentions that these men, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
tenants of the bishop, dean, and chapter should have
nor enjoy our laws and customs, unless after the
same manner as we enjoy them”&mdash;that is, as they
went on carefully to explain, every one must
acknowledge law as well as privilege, and be subject
like the citizens to authority. They were all to be
obedient to the Bailiff for the execution of the King’s
writs; nor could they claim any immunities or independent
jurisdiction in the King’s highway, seeing
that all offenders taken there were to be judged by
the city Bailiff. If the peace or the tranquillity of
Hereford was disturbed by the tenants of any fee,
the city Bailiff, “taking with him the bailiff of that
fee and twelve of the most discreetest and stoutest
men of the whole city,” might “by all way of rigour”
compel the offenders to come before them, and force
them to end their discords and make amends; if they
refused, the whole community “shall account and
hold them as rebels; and that they come not among
them in their congregations.”<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> All bailiffs, whether
of Church estates or others, were bound to help the
chief Bailiff of the city in apprehending thieves and
malefactors and keeping order. A vagabond, even if
he were an ecclesiastical tenant, who made a noise at
night “to the terror of his fellow-citizens,” might be
taken up by any inhabitant and brought to the city
jail till one o’clock the next day; when, in polite recognition
of the lower jurisdictions, he was solemnly
handed over in a public place to the bailiff of his
own fee, by him to be kept in prison for a day
and a night, and then returned to the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
prison, “there to stay until he hath made amends
as the Bailiff and commonalty shall think fit.” The
tenants of the various fees were allowed to plead in
the town courts at their pleasure, a privilege not
granted to aliens; and in matters touching frankpledge,
or anything “which could not be amended
in the courts of those lords,” the city claimed rights
of arbitration, and power to determine such cases
“according to the laws of the city and not according
to the customs, unless it be by special favour of the
commonalty.”<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> All questions concerning lands and
tenements in the city were to be decided by the free
citizens only; and if ecclesiastical tenants refused to
submit to the jurisdiction of the city magistrates and
absented themselves from the court, “then our chief
Bailiff, calling unto him six or more witnesses of his
citizens, shall go to the cathedral church, and there
before the chapter shall notify or declare the disobedience
of their bailiffs and of their tenants.” If
the canons would not assist or agree, the Bailiff
should announce that he must then proceed himself
to administer full justice, though “by his will or
knowledge he would not hurt the liberties of their
mother the Church.” This concession to ecclesiastical
sensibilities was apparently looked on by the men of
Hereford as a proof of fine magnanimity. “And it
was not wont so to be done, but that there was a
composition had between us, which we for the
reverence of God and the tranquillity of their tenants
and our citizens, had granted unto them.”</p>

<p>All this story, however, comes to us from the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of the town, and has something of the ring of a
lordly municipal pride; it almost sounds like an ideal
view of the compromise between the contracting
powers as conceived by the burghers, and one to
which the Church party must have demurred. At
any rate by whatever means the municipality of
Hereford had won a jurisdiction of this sort over the
bishop’s tenants, it was singular in the possession of
such authority, which has no parallel in towns like
Canterbury, York, Lincoln, Norwich, Exeter, and many
more. But the situation, even as the citizens put it,
is so complicated in its arrangements that we could
scarcely wonder if a state of truce depending on
provisions so elaborate should under provocation be
transformed into a state of open war; nor can we
question the wisdom of townspeople everywhere in
making it their fixed purpose to establish one undivided
and supreme law for the government of each
community. How important the question at issue
really was to the town’s life we may see from the
story of Winchester.</p>

<p>The mayor of Winchester was at the head of what
seems, on paper at least, a powerful and elaborate
corporation, worthy of a great city which held itself
to have been built “in the age of the world 2995,
ninety-nine years before the building of Rome,” and
“environed with stone walls” exactly 533 years later.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
A common assembly met twice a year. There were two
coroners and two constables, six aldermen of the wards
with their six beadles, a town clerk and four serjeants,
a council of twenty-four elected every year, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
four auditors of this council, besides a body of twelve
jurors chosen whenever there was necessity, who sat
at “the Pavilion,” and with whom the mayor perambulated
the liberties to view the rivulets and rivers.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
The boundaries of the city were apparently marked
out by a rough square formed by the walls and ditch;
but to the mayor and aldermen of the fifteenth
century, the idea that their authority should reach
as far as the limits allowed by the girth of the walls
would have seemed a far-off counsel of perfection.</p>

<p>For right across the city from the east to the west
gates stretched the High Street, cutting the town into
two equal halves; and to the south of the High Street
one may say roughly that the mayor had no authority
at all. Near the west gate stood the King’s castle,
where municipal law of course did not run. Beside
the castle lay the great convent of S. Swithun,
and next to it the cathedral, both fenced round by a
wall which shut out all lay jurisdiction or intrusion of
any kind. Nearer to the east gate lay the palace of
the bishop, who was also of course exempt from secular
interference, and who ruled with supreme authority
over the bishop’s Soke that stretched away beyond
the gate, and took tolls of all merchandise that passed
along the river.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> His tenants while remaining
outside municipal control had still the right to buy
and sell all kinds of merchandize in the city which
according to the burghers’ complaint was to their hurt
and loss; and the exceeding difficulty of any regulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of trade in the midst of this competition of privileged
workers, with the ruin of the city treasury which
it threatened, are shown by a quarrel between the
bishop and the burghers as to a street which the bishop
had claimed as his property in 1275; for when people
discovered that in that liberty so appropriated they
paid nothing, since the city bailiff could not enter it
to make distraint, nearly all the clothworkers forthwith
withdrew themselves from the other streets and
went to live there to the manifest loss of the community,
and the great profit of the bishop.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>The northern part of the town was more than half
given up to fields and gardens, the shops and houses
of traders and artizans forming but a narrow settlement
that gathered closely along the central street
and the lanes that opened from it. And even of
this district a part was wholly withdrawn from the
city jurisdiction. The Queens, whose “morning gift”
Winchester was, lived “tax free” in the Queen’s House
opposite the King’s palace near the west gate, and
took rent and tolls from the row of Queen’s stalls on
the High Street. At the east gate was another belt
of ecclesiastical property&mdash;the settlements of the
Franciscans and Dominicans,&mdash;and next to them a
group of poor houses depending on S. Swithun’s.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Right in the middle of the town, opposite the Guild
Hall in the High Street, was the liberty of “Godbeate”
belonging to S. Swithun’s, where the writ of the King
or the authority of the city had no power; and whose
church formed a sanctuary always open for ill-doers
flying from municipal justice. The very curfew-bell
which hung in its tower rang out from land that defied
the mayor’s authority.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Winchester had not even control of its own gates.
The bishop had charge of one; and two were in the
hands of the convent, which in times of civil war
could freely admit within the city walls the armies
of the side opposed to the townsfolk.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Even the
commerce of the place was taken out of the burghers
hands. Not only did the bishop take tolls of the
river traffic, but once a year when the great fair of
S. Giles’ took place he assumed supreme command
in Winchester; for the time all civic government was
altogether suspended; the bishop closed all shops in
and round the town; traders coming with their cloth
and woollen goods, their wines, their pottery, their
brass-work, or their eastern spices, were subject to his
jurisdiction, and handed over to him the biggest share
of the profits, which he divided with the various
religious establishments in the city.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> At other times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the King’s chamberlains and the King’s clerk of the
market regulated business in their master’s interest,
and collected the dues of the market and tolls on
every load carried by man or horse into the town.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Winchester suffered also from the memory of its
ancient state as the capital and residence of the West
Saxon Kings; and its mayor almost alone among
the mayors of English towns in the fifteenth century
had to go to London to take his oath of
office from the King’s judges,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> just as the mayor of
London does to this day. He could win neither freedom
nor independence. At home he was beset with
dangers; he might be imprisoned by the King for
one offence, and punished by the bishop for another.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Against such odds as the burghers had to face it
was almost hopeless for any corporation to contend;
and the helpless townsfolk could but show their
impatience and discontent in petty quarrels with
the convent as to the site of a market, or blindly
do battle for worthless Kings such as Henry the
Third or Edward the Second if the monks took up
the opposite party.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> The struggle for independence
has no fine record of stirring incidents; but that
there should have been any conflict at all before the
settling down of quiescence and final apathy is a
striking instance of the vitality and persistence of
municipal institutions.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to attribute to the hopeless
situation of the municipality before the rival authorities
in the city, and especially the powerful lords
of convent and cathedral, much of the calamity of
its history. For at a time when prosperity was
generally increasing, its fortunes steadily sank. In
1450 the citizens drew a terrible picture of the local
distress, not in the vague phrases which we meet
with elsewhere when for some special purpose happier
boroughs put on a temporary show of distress, but
with a minute exactness which betrays the truth and
the whole measure of their suffering. Winchester,
they declared, “is become right desolate.” Nine
hundred and ninety-seven houses stood empty, and in
seventeen parish churches there was no longer any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
service. A list is given of eleven streets “that be
fallen down in the city of Winchester within eighty
years last passed”; and in each case an account is
added of the number of householders that had
formerly lived in the street, a hundred, a hundred
and forty, or two hundred, as the case might be, where
there were now but two or three left. Since the last
Parliament held there eighty-one households had
fallen. “The desolation of the said poor city is so
great, and yearly falling, for there is such a decay
and unwin, that without gracious comfort of the King
our sovereign lord, the mayor and the bailiffs must
of necessity cease, and deliver up the city and the
keys into the King’s hands.”<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> To produce a distress
such as this no doubt industrial causes were at work,
and Winchester probably suffered as Canterbury did
from changes in the woollen manufacture and in
trade routes. But nowhere in any considerable city
do we find a parallel to the utter ruin of this unfortunate
community. Nowhere, on the other hand,
were the conditions of municipal life so fatal, if once
prosperity began to dwindle or the pressure of outward
circumstances became such as to call on the
resources of the people. Through the breaking up
of the city into separate and independent fragments
the whole burden of any difficulty had to be borne
by the little company of inhabitants governed by the
mayor; and so heavily did the common municipal
charges and expenses fall on the scanty population of
burghers shut into the narrow area which was under
municipal government, and from which alone the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
authorities could gather the fee-farm and the royal
taxes, maintain the bridge and walls, provide householders
for the nightly watch, and furnish men and
arms for the defence of the city; and we do not
wonder that the inhabitants at last began to renounce,
or refuse to accept, a franchise which brought
such formidable responsibilities, or that they sought
to escape from a city doomed to ruin. An attempt
was made in 1430 to revive manufacture and commerce
by an invitation to all kinds of traders
and artificers to come and do business in Winchester
free of toll.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> But the experiment in free
trade was quickly abandoned, probably because the
corporation could not meet the heavy yearly expenses
without the customary taxes levied on trade;<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>
and in 1450 the citizens laid a petition before Henry
the Sixth, praying him to consider the extent of
their distress. They were bound, they said, to pay
yearly a rent of 112 marks to the King, “for
the which said fee-farm so to be paid your bailiffs
have little or naught of certainty to raise it of,
but only of casualties and yearly leases £40 or
more.” There was further a sum of £50 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
for the tax of the fifteenth, “the which when it
is levyable, some one man in the said city is set
unto four marks and some five marks, because
your said city is desolate of people.” Then came
a sum of 60<i>s.</i> to be paid yearly to the Magdalen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Hospital;<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> and besides that there were the expenses
of two burgesses to Parliament who cost 4<i>s.</i> a day;
“and also the great charges and daily costs the which
your said poor city beareth about the enclosing and
murage of your said city.”<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> To add to all their
trouble a grant which the king had made to the
municipality in 1439 of forty marks from the ulnage
and subsidies of woollen cloths had been withdrawn
again; and the commonalty sadly entreat that it may
be restored.</p>

<p>The King allowed the payment of the forty marks
during the next fifty years, and Winchester made
one or two further attempts at mending its fortunes.
The people of Southampton had as long ago as 1406
succeeded in obtaining a license from the bishop
of Winchester, to buy and sell within their town
during the fair of St. Giles;<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> and the mayor and
community of Winchester perhaps hoped to follow this
example. In 1451 they raised a debate as to the
franchises and customs of the fair, and interfered with
the bishop’s privileges; but their usual ill luck
pursued them and they were obliged to submit and
give a promise that he should never again be disturbed
from having the keeping of the city and the
customs aforesaid.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> A few years later a transient
gleam of hope was cast across the unhappy town
when the Italian merchants were driven out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
London in 1456, and in this sudden emergency
hired the “great old mansions”<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> which the Winchester
traders had allowed to fall into decay, putting
the owners to heavy expenses for repairs. But
they seem never to have occupied the mansions
after all. Perhaps they were disheartened by the
sense of failing trade and oppressive taxes; or
they possibly feared the dangers that might come to
them in a town that had never been allowed powers
to govern and defend and deal fairly by its own
townsfolk. In any case they left the big empty
houses to go to Southampton, and Winchester was
none the better.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>Winchester was an extreme instance of difficulties
which were felt in every other town in a greater or
less degree. For scarcely any important borough was
without some ecclesiastical settlement within its
walls, and everywhere the dispute took the gravest
form. With the King or with a neighbouring lord
the boroughs might make terms of peace, or impose
conditions as conquerors, but their most imposing
demonstrations were inevitably routed before the
power of the Church. Outbreaks of popular fury in
which from time to time the irritation of the burghers
found expression have often been represented as
symptoms of a spirit of malice and misrule by which
an ignorant mob was instigated to attack the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
beneficent institution known to their society and with
no justification save from their lawless temper seek to
appropriate to themselves its privileges and possessions.
But the causes of the conflict were more valid and
serious. As the instances given in the next chapter
prove, the burghers learned by a genuine experience
to gauge the beneficence of the Church’s claims to
temporal authority. There does not seem to have
been in England, as there often was abroad, the
additional stimulus of religious revolt, for the
practical townspeople apparently did not find the
slightest difficulty in distinguishing between spiritual
influence and secular jurisdiction, mainly perhaps
because the power of the ecclesiastical potentates in
England was of so limited a kind as to awaken but
a moderate fear and equally moderate excitement.
But in face of the secular problem created by the
presence of a rival authority ruling over half the space
enclosed in the town walls&mdash;an authority with which
no permanent agreement could ever be concluded and
which was manifestly fatal to the dignity or the success
of municipal government&mdash;the boroughs were
forced, as a mere matter of self-preservation, into
insistent and reiterated demands that this double
rule should be abolished, and that there should be
but one undivided and supreme control in each
community for civil affairs. When the pole-axes
and daggers with which they at first sought to enforce
their convictions were laid aside, they turned
to the law-courts and the paper wars of Westminster
to seek a remedy for their grievances;
and it is in the records of trials from the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of the fifteenth century to the Reformation in
which the pleadings of both sides may be heard
that we find the real justification of the burghers’
claim to civic supremacy, and of their determined
assaults on the political independence of ecclesiastical
communities.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TOWNS AND THE CHURCH</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the history of Winchester we may perhaps find
a clue to the explanation of that great controversy
which for centuries divided the mediæval municipalities
and the religious corporations into two hostile armies,&mdash;armies
that chafed under the restraints of an
enforced and angry truce, and from time to time
broke into the brief exhilaration of a free fight.
There were certain towns, such as Exeter or Canterbury
or Norwich, where the municipality was as free
as royal charters could make it and acknowledged no
dependence on Cathedral or Priory, and where
notwithstanding Town and Church were always in
arms against one another, and the task of adjusting
their mutual relations presented such insoluble
difficulties that every other question seemed of easy
settlement in comparison with a problem so insistent,
so manifold in its forms, so tremendous in its proportions
in the eyes of burgher and of ecclesiastic. The
convent or chapter, entrenched behind its circuit of
walls and towers, with its own system of laws, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
own executive, its independent trade and revenues,
had practically no interest either in the prosperity
or the security of the town, while its keenest activities,
whether from the point of view of business or
religion, were enlisted in uncompromising defence
of ecclesiastical privilege. On the other hand the
body of burghers, conscious of the difficulties of
government, with a mass of complicated business
thrown on their hands and a heavy financial responsibility,
nervously keeping guard over their franchises,
inspired by a commanding sense of the importance
of strict organization, and an ambition stimulated
by tradition, success, and capacity, found in common
experience reasons for judging that a double
system of law and a double authority was the negation
of order, peace, or material prosperity in their little
republic. Their avowed object was to put an end to
this division of the borough into two camps, and to
secure for the community the ultimate control of
administration within the city boundaries. Hence the
issues raised between the townspeople and the clerical
order were direct and clear. Questions of temporal
and spiritual power, of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, of
the immunities claimed by the “clergy,” of the gulf
that separated the servant of the Church from the
citizen of the State&mdash;all these things were forced
home to the people with the sharpness, variety, and
force of practical illustration. The war which in
the twelfth century had been waged on behalf of
the State and the Church by their great representatives,
Henry the Second and Archbishop Thomas,
was during the next three centuries brought down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
into every borough and fought out there in more
humble fashion by provincial mayors and ecclesiastics
of a circumscribed and stinted fame.</p>

<p>And as the quarrel was long so it was practically
universal. It was this that made the struggle so
momentous. Few boroughs after all were subject to
the absolute rule of ecclesiastical lords; and their
attempts to win freedom were local, isolated, without
national significance. But all the great towns had
one or more ecclesiastical bodies established within
their boundaries, and all were able to appreciate the
character of the conflict entailed on them. Nor
were the consequences of the dispute exaggerated
by the combatants on either side. During centuries
of strife they had abundant opportunity of gauging
its importance&mdash;from the time of Edward the
First, when, by the enclosing of churchyards and
ecclesiastical precincts with walls, the attempt was
made to shut in religious authorities within their
own limits, and give the town undivided responsibility
outside these boundaries&mdash;till the time when
triumphant burghers saw walls and towers levelled
to the ground under Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>For in the war waged by burghers against clerics
who used spiritual authority to create temporal sovereignty,
and in this temporal power then found means
to enforce spiritual claims,&mdash;though the combatants
were people of no account, fighting their quarrel out
in remote and isolated boroughs, and though the noise
of the battle no longer resounded as it had once done
throughout Europe,&mdash;the conflict was still the same,
the questions were as vital for the just ordering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
human society, and the tenacity of the opponents
was as great as ever. The disputes covered the
whole field of practical life. In matters of trade there
was not only the rivalry of two trading companies
under different conditions of wealth, influence, and
protection;<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> but even in the case of individuals there
was unfair competition, as when a citizen gave up his
dwelling in the town, obtained a corrody in some
ecclesiastical house, and claimed the benefits of citizenship
without bearing its obligations.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> Sometimes the
burghers found themselves called to defend against
the ecclesiastical lawyers a right which had been
proved essential to their freedom&mdash;the right of being
tried only in their own courts&mdash;and the commonalty
would make ordinances that no process-server should
carry or cite elsewhere men or women living in the
borough, and the jury of the Leet Court kept watch
and made their presentment of summoners, commissary,
and clerks who had dealt lightly with the
liberties or goods of the citizens, or called them to
distant courts.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Or again, the invaluable privilege of
having all matters that concerned the commons of the
borough tried by a jury of inhabitants and not of
aliens, might be put in jeopardy. In Lincoln the dean
and chapter had a special grudge against trials “by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
people of the same city, which be so favourable one
to another that they doubt not to make false oaths,
and that because they be encouraged, forasmuch as
they have not been before this time convict by
foreigners by colour of their franchise.” On their
complaint “our lord the King, willing, for the cause
aforesaid, <i>to provide for the quietness of the said
church</i>, and full right to be done as well to the said
bishop, dean, and chapter and their successors,” ordered
that henceforth “if any of the parties feel himself
grieved of a false oath made by such assize, jury,
or inquest, the attaint shall be granted to him, and
the record sent by writ into the King’s Bench or
into the Common Pleas; and that the sheriff impanel
the jury of such attaint of foreigners of the
county, without sending to the franchise of the said
city, and that the justices shall take the same jury
of the same foreigners, notwithstanding any franchise
granted to the same city, or other usage to the contrary.”<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
The question of sanctuary, too, remained a
standing trouble, and the bailiffs of the borough who
sent town clerks and town serjeants to make proclamation
for weeks together at the abbey gate calling
upon a debtor who had fled from his creditors to
appear for judgement, had small sympathy with the
abbot’s privileges.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Whenever burghers had liberty
and opportunity to act on their own judgement
they found no difficulty in coming to a decision as
to the sanctity imposed by religion on territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
consecrated to sacred uses. From old premises they
drew new conclusions. “As holiness becomes the
Lord’s House,” declared the mayor, jurats, and whole
community of Rye in 1483, “in future, to the honour
of God and of the glorious Virgin Mary, the parish
church of the said town, with the churchyard and
the manse of the vicarage thereof, shall be of the
same freedom, and with as much liberty as the other
houses of the freemen, especially as to arrests and
other matters.”<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>There is perhaps no better illustration of the
character and conditions of the controversy between
town and church than the story of the quarrel between
Exeter city and the Cathedral, which has been preserved
for us in the letters of an able mayor, who at a very
important crisis conducted the case of his fellow-citizens
against the chapter, and whose phrases,
written in the heat of battle, carry us back into the
very midst of a long-forgotten strife. Descended from
an old county family which had thrown in its lot with
the burghers of Exeter and become traders in the city
and leaders in its counsels, John Shillingford was
born into a tradition of civic patriotism. His father
served as mayor from 1428 to 1430 and was noted for
being learned in the law; and John Shillingford
himself was mayor three times, and the distinguished
leader from 1445 to 1448 of a struggle for independence
which was already a hundred and fifty years old.</p>

<p>From 1206 or earlier Exeter had been governed
by its own mayor and bailiffs, and the citizens
held their town at a fee-farm rent from the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
But a century later the mayor was a mere dependent
of the Earl of Devonshire, wearing his “livery” as
one of his retainers and acknowledging his protection.
However it happened on a certain day in 1309 that
the earl and bishop made an attempt to buy all the
fish in the Exeter market, leaving none for the townsfolk.
Then the mayor, “minding the welfare of the
commons of the said city, and that they also might
have the benefit of the said market,” ruled that one-third
of the fish must be given to the citizens. The
earl with loud threatenings angrily ordered his rebellious
dependent to appear before him. Followed by
a tumultuous procession of “his brethren and honest
commons of the said city,” the mayor went from
the Guild Hall to the earl’s house, entered his lord’s
“lodging chamber,” and there took off his “livery”
coat and gave it back to the earl once for all, the
commons meanwhile beating at the door and loudly
demanding their mayor, till the terrified earl entreated
him to quiet their clamour. The town forthwith
passed a law that no citizen should ever again
wear “foreigner’s livery,” and so began the long
fight for municipal independence.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>For the same two great powers ever kept watch
on the Exeter citizens and their market, if by
chance there was any profit which could be turned
their way. At the town gates the Earls of Devonshire
held Exe Island and the adjoining suburb, commanded
the navigation of the Exe, forced the mayor
to lay aside his mace as he approached the suburb,
and sought to recall the days when he had worn their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
livery. A more dangerous enemy was encamped within
the walls. Just opposite the little town-hall rose the
great wall with its towers which guarded the bishop’s
palace, the cathedral, and the ecclesiastical precincts;
and within this fortified enclosure ruled an august
power that defied the petty upstart forces of the
mayor and his group of shopkeepers outside. The
conflict of the town with the Earls,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> if it lasted for
something like three hundred years, was still of minor
significance. The conflict with the Church was far
more dangerous in form and serious in its issues.</p>

<p>The town and the close, as we are told by the
mayor in 1448, had “been in debate by divers
times almost by time of eightscore years, and that
I could never know, find nor read that we ever took
a suit against them, but ever stand in defence as
a buckler player, and smiter never.”<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Now at last,
however, the citizens were resolved “once to smite,
taking a suit,”<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> as became the temper and traditions
of the fifteenth century when such quarrels were
fought out, not with clubs and daggers, but in the
“paper wars of Westminster.” As the crisis approached
the townsfolk made ready for the fray.
Determined that their battle should be conducted
by the most capable man among them, at Michaelmas,
1444, they elected as their mayor John Shillingford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
He refused to accept office, upon which
they sent to Westminster and procured a writ
under the Privy Seal ordering him either to submit
or pay a fine of £1,000, a sum which probably no
single individual in Exeter at that time possessed.
In February 1445 therefore, he “came to the Guild
Hall and there was sworn; and though at the first
with an evil will, yet in the end did perform it
very well,”<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>&mdash;so well indeed that the bishop even
saw in “the wilful labour of John Shillingford” the
main cause of all “the great hurt and loss of the said
church and city.”<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Once Mayor Shillingford quickly threw down
his challenge to the chapter. On Ascension Day,
1445, the city serjeant followed a servant of the
chancellor into the precincts, and there arrested him
when he was actually taking part in a procession,
holding up from the ground his master’s golden
cope;<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and two more arrests of clerks followed in a
little over a year. A new mayor took his place at
Michaelmas 1445, but when in April 1446 the chapter
prepared to bring a suit against the town, laying the
damages at £1,000, the city again fell back on
Shillingford and for the two critical years of the
strife he remained supreme magistrate and led the
fight as it broadened so as to cover the whole range
of the civic life. Party strife ran high, and the
inhabitants were soon on terms of open war. On one
occasion in the midst of the quarrel, a great stack of
wood which lay between the cathedral and the town
was set on fire at nine o’clock in the shortest time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the year. This, the burgesses cried out, was done by
the ministers of the cathedral to burn down the town.
The charge was thrown back in their teeth by the
canons, who protested it was set afire by men of the
same city deliberately by consent of the commonalty
with intent to burn the church.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> The tossing to and fro
of such an accusation gives us a glimpse of the state
of feeling that existed. The cathedral party hated
the townspeople as a usurping and rebellious mob;
while to the townsfolk when their passion was aroused
the cathedral within its walls wore the aspect of a
fortress in their midst, held by the power of an ancient
enemy.</p>

<p>Which was the “smiter” in the quarrel it would
be indeed hard to say. The claims raised on either
side were absolutely irreconcilable, and each denied
with great frankness and conviction every assertion
put forward by the other. For convincing
proof of its own dignity the corporation boldly
carried back its inquiries to some unknown period
before the Christian era, when Exeter “was a city
walled, and suburb to the same of most reputation;”
and recounted how “soon upon the passion of Christ
it was besieged by Vespasian by time of eight days;
the which obtained not the effect of his siege, and so
wended forth to Bordeaux, and from Bordeaux to
Rome, and from Rome to Jerusalem, and then he
with Titus besieged Jerusalem and obtained and sold
thirty Jews’ heads for a penny, as it appeareth by
Chronicles.” They then passed on to its position
under the Saxon Kings; and thence came directly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
the privileges of the mayor, derived from the good old
time when bailiffs and citizens held the town in
fee-farm from the King, before any monastery or
cathedral church was built.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> All the historical research
on this side in fact plainly proved the ecclesiastical
authority to be a mere modern usurpation, of no
credit or value.</p>

<p>The bishop and chapter for their part ignored the
times before Vespasian, and bluntly “say that they
doubt of Vespasian’s being at Exeter, and so at
Bordeaux and Jerusalem, to sell thirty Jews’ heads
for a penny;” so coming at once to their main contention,
they declared that St. Stephen’s Fee was no
parcel of the city, as the Book of Domesday would
show, and was indeed “of elder time than is the
city,” for Exeter was nothing more than a borough
till the first bishop had been installed there by the
Confessor. Indeed they observed that the mayor
himself was well known to be an officer of yesterday,
since till the time of Henry the Third there “was no
mayor nor fee-farm,” but the town was governed by
the sheriff of the county, and the bishops in their
sphere had absolute jurisdiction, “without that time
out of mind there were any such mayor, bailiffs, and
commonalty known in the city.”<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>But all the arguments of the bishop, “that blessed
good man in himself if he must be Edmund, Bishop
of Exeter,”<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> as the mayor politely remarked, were
thrown away on Shillingford. “I said nay, and proved
it by Domesday,”<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> he writes, fully satisfied that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
lord “had no more knowledge of the ground of this
matter than the image in the cloth of arras there”<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>&mdash;a
melancholy ignorance, “considering his blessedness,
holy living, and good conscience.” The prelate’s
history, indeed, like that of his antagonist, was not
without reproach. Domesday makes no mention of any
separate lands of the Church in Exeter; but copies of
Domesday were scarce, and it was tolerably safe to refer
to its authority. In any case, however, the daily
pressure of circumstance was so strong that it mattered
very little to the opposing forces whether ancient
history justified their position or no. To the burghers
the difficulties of a divided administration, and the
humiliation of submission, were made more galling
every day by the growing prosperity of the town
and the independent temper of the time; while the
chapter, confident in the legal strength of their
position, had not the least hesitation in forcing on the
conflict.</p>

<p>The suit which opened in London in 1447 was
complicated and costly,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and mayor and law officers
and town councillors in Exeter had to put forth all
their resources. Perpetual consultations were carried
on in the Town Hall with the help of much malmsey;
once two plovers and a partridge helped the feast.
As time went on the expenses in meat and drink
were heavy; judges had to be feasted, and the municipal
officers encouraged, and presents were needed
for the great folk in London, besides the serious cost
of sending messengers continually to London, Tiverton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and Crediton. Even after the matter was finally
decided the city had to make up in the next year
rewards of money, and gifts of fish and wine, for
which it was still in debt.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>The most arduous and costly part of the work,
however, lay in the vast amount of historical and
legal research which the case demanded. “It asketh
many great ensearches,” said Shillingford, “first in
our treasury at home among full many great and old
records; afterward at Westminster, first in the Chancery,
in the Exchequer, in the Receipt, and in the
Tower; and all these ensearches asketh great labour
long time as after this, to make our articles we have
many true against one of theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Evidences and
documents were read and re-read, and arguments
brought from the Black Roll of the city, from Domesday
Book, from Magna Charta, from statutes, charters, and
letters patent, from the eyres holden at Exeter by
the judges of Edward the First, from records of the
“customs” under Henry the Third or Edward the
Third. The Recorder of Exeter worked hard, and
the mayor turned confidently to him when legal
questions became peculiarly obscure. It “is dark
to my conceit as yet,” he writes from London;
“but I trust to God it shall be right well with
your good information and help thereto; to which
intent I send you a roll in the which is contained
copies of Domesday, copy of eyres, of charters,
and other things that is necessary to be seen in
making of these replications. I can no more at this
time, but I pray you be not weary to over-read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
hear and see all the writing that I have sent home
to you at this time; and if you be, no marvel
though I be weary, and God be with you.”<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p>Shillingford himself was constantly in London;
where the record of one day’s work may serve as an
instance of his activity. He left Exeter at 6
o’clock on Wednesday morning, and reached London
on Saturday at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> “That day I had right great
business,” he says. First he went to the Exchequer to
see about Exmouth Port; then to Westminster
Hall to speak with various lawyers; after that he
visited the chief justice, Sir John Fortescue, and rode
with him homeward; then he called on another justice,
Sir Richard Newton; from thence he went to
commune “with our counsel of our matters;” and in
the afternoon proposed to visit the archbishop at
Lambeth.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Meanwhile he kept a certain watch over
affairs at home, and sent an occasional order as to
the conduct of local business in Exeter. “Also I
charge Germin (the treasurer) under rule and commandment
of J. Coteler, my lieutenant, that he do
that he can do, brawl, brag and brace, lie and swear
well to, and in special that the streets be right clean
and specially the little lane in the back-side beneath
the flesh-fold gate, for there lieth many oxen heads
and bones, that they be removed away for the nonce
against my coming, as soon as I may by cokky’s
bones.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>From London long letters to the “Fellowship” at
home rehearsed every step of the negociations, from the
moment when the mayor first “came to Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
soon upon nine of the bell, and there met with my
lord chancellor at the broad door a little from the
stair-foot coming from the Star Chamber, I in the
court, and by the door kneeling and saluting him
in the most goodly wise that I could, and recommended
unto his good and gracious lordship my
fellowship and all the commonalty, his own people
and bedesmen of the city of Exeter. He said to
the mayor two times ‘Welcome’ and the third
time ‘Right welcome, mayor,’ and held the mayor
a great while fast by the hand, and so went forth
to his barge and with him great press, lords and
other.”<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> In the same way Shillingford notes
carefully every detail of the grave ceremonial
observed before the arbiters of the city’s destiny,
when “my lord took his chair and the justices
sat with him, and both parties with their counsel
kneeled before.”<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Then followed a long argument in
which the mayor held his own against the lawyers,
and “so we departed, standing afar from my lord,
and he asked wine and sent me his own cup, and
to no more;”<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> also “my lord in this time did me
much worship and openly ... commended me for my
good rule at home.” When a letter from the mayor
was addressed to the lord chancellor, we hear how the
recorder “kissed the letter and put it into my lord’s
blessed hand, and my lord with a glad countenance
received the letter, and said that the mayor and all
the commons should have Christ’s blessing and his,
and bade my master Radford<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> to stand up, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
did, and anon my lord brake the letter even while
grace was saying, and there right read it every deal
or he went to his dinner.”</p>

<p>Business in London was best furthered by judicious
gifts, and Exeter was constantly called on to
send fish to the chancellor&mdash;conger eel, 400 of
buckhorn or dried whiting, or a “fish called crabs.”<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
Or again when the prudent mayor heard the lord
chancellor bid the justice to dinner for a Friday, “I
did as methought ought to be done ... and sent
thither that day two stately pickerellis and two
stately tenches.”<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> This proved a very successful
venture, as “it came in good season” for the great
lords and bishops who dined with the chancellor that
day. At one stage of the business indeed the mayor
thought it unwise to proceed with his argument
until a certain present of fish should arrive. “I
tarried and yet tarried because of the buckhorn,
the which came not yet, me to right great anger
and discomfort by my troth ... for it had been a
good mean and order, after speaking and communication
above-said, the buckhorn to have been presented,
and I to have come thereafter, and so to have sped
much the better; but now it is like to fail to hindering.”<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
Whether it was the fault of the treasurer
of the town, or of the carrier, he did not know;
he was sure each would accuse the other. “Christ’s
curse have they both,” he breaks out, “and say
ye amen, <i>non sine merito</i>, and but ye dare say so,
think so, think so!” At last the buckhorn arrived on
Candlemas even&mdash;”better late than never,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
irritated mayor. “That day was I at Lambeth with
my lord at mass, and offered my candle to my lord’s
blessed hand, I kneeling adown offering my candle.
My lord with laughing cheer upon me said heartily
‘Graunt mercy, mayor;’ and that same day I
abode there to meat by my said lord’s commandment;
I met with my lord at high table end coming
to meatward, and as soon as ever he saw me
he took me fast by the hand and thanks enough to;
I said to my said lord it was too simple a thing
considering his estate to say on his ‘graunt mercy,’
but if I had been at home at this fair he should
have had better stuff and other things. I went
forth with him to the midst of the hall, he standing
in his estate against the fire a great while, and
two bishops, the two chief justices, and other lords,
knights and squires, and other common people great
multitude, the hall full, all standing afar apart from
him, I kneeling by him, and after recommendation
I moved him of our matter shortly as time asked.”
He closed this argument against the prelate’s malpractices
in his most graceful manner&mdash;”I in my
leave-taking saying these words, ‘My lord have pity
and mercy upon that poor city, <i>Jesus vidit civitatem
et flevit super eam</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>But amid all the fashions of the chancellor’s court
the mayor never for a moment lost the sense of his
own dignity as the representative of a free city.
Deferential and scrupulous in paying the grave
courtesies of an exact formality, Shillingford was
inflexible in all that lay beyond mere ceremonial;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
for, as he said, “the matter toucheth the great
commonalty of the city of Exeter as well as him.”<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
“The said mayor,” he writes on one occasion, “conceived
and knew right well that his said lord bishop
took unworthy, as he might right well, for simpleness
and poverty to speak or entreat with him.
Nevertheless he said, such simple as he was, he was
Mayor of Exeter.”<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> In every dilemma he fell back
haughtily on his own “simpleness,” and on his subjection
to the town council at home, “having no
power, nor nought may do, say, agree, nor assent,
without a communication had with my fellowship&mdash;a
commonalty which is hard to deal with,”<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> added
the artful mayor, with a humour which his submissive
subjects at Exeter doubtless fully appreciated.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>We may safely assume that great labour and cost
were not expended without some serious reason by
the Exeter citizens&mdash;a community of hard-working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
practical traders, who knew the value both of their
time and their money. And in the mayor’s accounts
of the proceedings in London we can gather up the
long list of grievances which had gone on accumulating
within the walls of this little city between
Church and State, till the inhabitants found themselves
ranged in two hostile armies, to either of which surrender
meant ruin and enslavement.</p>

<p>(1) The most burning question at issue was the
right of arrest of the bishop’s tenants, or within
the ecclesiastical precincts. Among many other
cases<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> the mayor alleged that of one “Hugh
Lucays, tenant of the said bishop, the most, or one
of the most, misgoverned men of all the city of
Exeter, or of all the shire afterward,” who made a
fray upon a townsman at the very door of the Guild
Hall, and when the sergeant seized him “brake
the arrest and went his way” into the church,
pursued by the two serjeants. The stewards of
the city who followed with the king’s mace to keep
the king’s peace found the church doors shut upon
them, and the prisoner “violently with strong
hand taken away from them”; and various clerks
and ministers of the church, by order of the dean
and chapter, fell on them with door-bars, swords,
daggers, long-knives, and “Irish skenes,” so that
“both stewards and serjeants stood in despair of their
lives, and scarce escaped out of the church with their
lives.”<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> This was the mayor’s story. The bishop
on his part said that Hugh Lucas was an innocent
man, who was driven into the cathedral during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
divine service by the turbulent mob of burghers
brandishing “swords, daggers, and other invasive
weapons,” and intent only on wickedness and misrule.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
Then again one of the bishop’s servants who had struck
a townsman in the eye with a dagger almost unto
death, could not be punished because he had been
standing within the Close gate, between the cemetery
and the city. “Also ofttimes the mayor hath not
dared do the law and execution thereof ... for now
almost every man taketh colour by my lord” the bishop.
If any riotous person made a fray, he would run off and
“take the church late;” if a man was arrested on
Saturday, “he must be delivered to make my lord’s
work” on Sunday,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> and by such devices both men and
women “by whom the mayor is rebuked” got off scot
free. A compromise had been made that the city officers
should make no arrests in church or cemetery from
the ceasing of Our Lady bell to the end of Compline,
but the chapter later laid this against them
in evidence that they had no right ever to make
any arrest there, “which is to the said mayor and
commonalty great vexation, hurt, and hindering;
and to misgoverned men, rioters, and breakers of
the peace great boldness.”<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> The mayor alleged
that it was impossible to keep order in face of
privileges which rendered the clergy and their tenants
practically independent of the law. “Night walking,
evil language, visaging, shouldering, and all
riotous rule” went on unchecked, seeing that the
mayor “could no longer rule the King’s people
after his laws, nor do right as he is sworn to, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
dread of my lord.”<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Just outside St. Peter’s Close
stood a well-known tavern, and the canons who
owned the Broad Gate kept its wicket open almost
all the night, “out of which wicket into which
tavern cometh the great part of all the rioters into
the Close, priests and others,” said the townspeople,
and there made sleep impossible the whole night
long to the neighbours. The canons however
held that the “mayor and such dreadful people of
his commonalty be the misgoverned people and
incomers that they spoke of.” According to the
clerical party indeed the whole municipal body was
altogether sunk in sin; the very town serjeants were
“wild and unreasonable fellows,” who had even been
heard to threaten “that there should many a priest
of the Close of Exeter lose his head once of midsummer
even;”<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> and as for the tavern, it was wholly the
mayor’s business to keep order there, unless indeed,
as they suggested, it was he himself “that is cause
and giver of example to all such misgovernance.”<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
This charge, however, which the chancellor had struck
out with his own hands, was one about which the
mayor did not greatly trouble himself. “As touching
the great venom that they meaneth of my living,” he
wrote to the Fellowship, “I take right nought by and
say sadly ‘<i>si recte vivas</i>,’ etc., and am right merry
and fare right well, ever thanking God and my
own purse. And I lying on my bed at the writing
of this right early, merrily singing a merry song, and
that is this ‘Come no more at our house, come, come,
come!’ I will not die nor for sorrow nor for anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
but be merry and fare right well, while I have
money; but that is and like to be scarce with me,
considering the business and cost that I have had
and like to have; and yet I had with me £20 and
more by my troth, whereof of troth not right much
I spend yet, but like, &amp;c. Construe ye what ye will.”<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>(2) It was a further grievance to the townspeople
that the bishop claimed the right to hold both
a court baron and leet and view of frankpledge,
and on this pretence called before himself various
pleas and matters that should have been tried before
the mayor and bailiffs, thus covetously gathering
into his coffers fines on which they themselves
had set longing eyes; and moreover that he took to
himself any goods seized from felons.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> There had
been angry feeling over the case of one John Barton,
whom the town officers pursued for robbing. But as
it was a church that he had robbed, and as he had
hidden the stolen goods in a tenement of the bishop’s,
the ecclesiastics, rather than see justice done by the
secular power, had shut the door in the face of the
municipal officers, and had hurried off the sacrilegious
thief into the cathedral, then smuggled him out into
a bakehouse, and so conveyed him out of the city;
while the stolen goods were kept with a strong hand
to the use of the bishop, “to great hurt and hindering
of our sovereign lord the King and the said mayor
and commonalty.”<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>(3) In all towns where the question of jurisdiction
was raised between the townsfolk and the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
party the quarrel about coroner’s inquests ran high.
Churchmen and laymen alike had to submit to the
coroner’s inquest. But chapters of cathedrals and
monasteries found it less humiliating to admit within
their precincts an officer of the shire than the town
officer sent in by a mayor who was for ever keeping
his jealous watch at their gates. On the other hand,
after their long and determined struggle to be freed
from foreign interference, the towns looked with
suspicion on the appearance within their walls on any
pretext whatever of any official of the shire. In Exeter
as elsewhere the city coroner claimed “to corowne
prisoners dead in the bishop’s prison,” but the bishop
flatly refused to admit into the precincts any officer
save the coroner of Devonshire, and if the municipal
coroners on hearing of a prisoner’s death appeared
at the gates of the Close, they were turned back by
“servants of the said bishop, and by his commandment
they were let to do their office there;
and the said prisoners so dead buried uncoroned.”<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>(4) There was also as might be expected a burning
controversy as to the city taxes.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The mayor alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
that he and his deputies had been accustomed to
collect in the cathedral precincts a certain proportion
of the King’s taxes, the ferm, and the sums needed
for general town expenses; and Shillingford supported
this claim before the lord chancellor by “a
long rehearsal thereof from King Edward’s time unto
this day, how and under what form it was done of
old time.”<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Of late however the bishop’s tenants
had refused to come to the Guild Hall and have
their share assessed, “by the commandment of the
said bishop menacing the said tenants ... to put
them out of their tenures. And so they durst not
come, set, nor pay as they have been wont to do.”<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
The bishop justified his action by a variety of arguments.
The King’s taxes he probably could not dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
with any show of reason. But with regard to the
ferm he employed a comprehensive mode of reasoning
which struck at the very foundation of all
authority of mayor or commonalty; for that, he said,
the town had no power whatever to collect, since
Exeter had neither mayor nor bailiffs nor any fee-ferm
at all till the time of Henry the Third, and even
then the grant was illegally made by Richard of
Almayne, who really possessed no rights in the
borough.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> For the taxes connected with municipal
expenses, or as the mayor called them, the “citizens’
spending,” he asserted that his tenants were not
legally responsible. In any case he differed altogether
from the citizens in his definition of the “ancient
custom” by which the payment of the taxes should
be regulated,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> and complained that his tenants had
not been duly summoned to take part in the assessment,
and “of malice” had been charged in their
absence “an importable sum ... so that there
would have remained in the mayor’s hands a great
sum thereof above the said dime,” like as there had
remained in other mayors’ hands as much as £7 or
£5, sometimes more or less.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>(5) In one of the most burdensome duties of town
life, the keeping of watch and ward, the dependents
of St. Peter’s fee had sought to throw the
whole labour on the citizens.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> The bishop’s tenants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
when they were summoned “to come and keep the
watch and the peace came not ... but they were
forbode upon a great pain, and charged if any of the
mayor’s officers entered into any tenement of the
bishop for to warn any man to come to the watch,
that they should break his head.”<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> The bishop in fact
had ordered that a fine of 40<i>s.</i>&mdash;a fine quite beyond
the power of an ordinary tradesman to pay&mdash;should be
levied from any one who dared to serve on the watch.
“Whereupon the mayor made right great wayward
language to them. The mayor said waywardly he
would do more, he would make levy both of the
citizens’ spending and the fee-farm, and that he would
well avow, and bade them of all to inform the Justice
thereof, and that he would do the same; and so the
mayor did.”<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>(6) “The most disclaunderous article” of all, according
to the bishop, was the question of the assize
of wine, ale, and bread. While the mayor claimed
the assize over the bishop’s demesne, the bishop
asserted that such assize “of time that no mind is”
belonged wholly to the bishop himself, and in no wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to the mayor.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> This matter was partly a question of
finance, and partly a question of order. So long as
wine was first smuggled in by the bishop’s tenants, and
then sold in the houses of the canons and in the precincts,
against “the ordinances and cry” made by the
mayor, the town lost the customs which ought to be
paid at the port of Exmouth on every pipe of wine;
and as the ferm was paid out of these customs, the
bishop’s tenants escaped their share of the rent,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> and
left the whole burden to be borne by the citizens.
The corporation further lost the “wine gavell” paid
on all wine sold by retail in the town. Moreover
fraudulent sellers went unpunished; for instead of
allowing the town officers to cast into the canal wine
which was condemned by the municipality as “corrupt
and not whole for man’s body, damnable and
which should be damned,” the bishop’s tenants actually
found means to gather from it profits of iniquity;
“the which corrupt wine hath been carried to Topsham
and there shipped, and so led to Bordeaux, there
to be put and melled among new wine, as it shall be
well proved if need be.” In the same way the weighing
of bread was resisted, and the due testing of
beer, and the authority of the city set at nought.</p>

<p>(7) There was also a quarrel about who was to get
the profits from increased rents of stalls and shops
and houses which opened on the market-place,<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> and
whose value altogether depended on the growth of
the market and the town trade. Both the municipality
and the church would willingly have seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the “unearned increment.” The convent had set up
stalls and booths “on the ground of the said mayor
and citizens without licence of them asked”&mdash;great
stalls sixty feet long and over three feet broad, where
of old time there had only been shop windows, “the
leaves thereof going inward, and none other never
were.” The bishop answered that any one in the
town might put stalls outside his own house if he
chose; and in any case, he added, with consistent
denial of the authority of the corporation, it was a
matter to be punished by the King, if at all, and not
by the commonalty. When the townsmen further
urged that they had always “of time that no mind
is” held their fish-market in Fish Street, a sort of
debateable land, which lay outside the cemetery but
within the precincts of the close, but that now the dean
and chapter had refused to let the market be held
there, and had themselves made stairs and gardens
encroaching on the street, which moreover cut off
the mayor’s way to the town walls and towers, the
bishop answered in quibbling wise that as there never
was such a street as Fish Street, no market could well
be held in it, nor could it be encroached upon:
what the town chose to call Fish Street, the prelate
explained, was in his nomenclature S. Martin’s or the
Canon’s Street.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>(8) As in other fortified towns, where the wall of
the ecclesiastical precincts ran side by side with the
city wall,<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> endless questions were raised as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
management and repair of walls and towers, and the
control of the city gates, and the use of the narrow
way that ran inside the wall for the movement of
troops, the carriage of ammunition, and the approach
of the city authorities, or of workmen&mdash;questions
which in time of war or of civil revolt
were of vital consequence, and which even in quiet
days brought frequent trouble. Each side claimed
the lane, and the mayor and corporation objected to
the canons who, having back doors opening from the
gardens into it, had made it into a mere rubbish heap,
so “that no man therein may well ride nor go nor
lead carriage to the walls, to the great hurt and
hindering of the mayor and commonalty;” and who
had further broken up the great drain which had
been made to draw off rain water from the town and
had carried away the stones. Moreover the commonalty
had spent £20 on building a great tower “and
right a strong door with lock and key made thereto
and fast shut, to this intent there to bring in stuff
for the war and defence of the city and other thing
more of the said city there to be kept strong, safe,
and sure; but whenever this lock, and those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
various postern doors, were repaired “they have
been right spitefully broke up by the bishop, and
dean and chapter,” and the door of the tower left at
all times open so that the canons could throw their
rubbish into it. And finally, the canons having
fitted one of the town gates with a new lock and
key of their own, by night and day “full ungodly
carriage have been led in and out.” “At which gate
also ofttime have been great affrays and debate,
and like to have been manslaughter, and divers
night-walkers and rioters coming out at that gate
into the city, and there have made many affrays,
assaults, and other riotous misgovernance against the
peace, and broken out over the town walls, and much
more mischief like to fall by that gate without better
remedy had.” To all these charges the canons
answered that the lane was their own property, nor
had they ever broken any gutter there nor thrown
rubbish out; and as to the wall it was the commonalty
which “by their frowardness to evil intent,” had let
it fall down and had not repaired it “in any time
this hundred year;” while the towers stood on
ecclesiastical ground, “and the bishop sometime had
his prison in that tower.”<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>(9) The common use of the cathedral became a
further subject of wrangling, as the corporation pressed
for sole authority within the tower inclosure and the
ecclesiastical party retorted by stricter protection of
its own peculiar property. It had been the custom
at fair-time to set up booths in the cemetery and even
within the church; but the dean and chapter now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
began to demand tolls, especially from the jewellers’
stalls. This the town angrily resented, and the matter
was referred to arbitrators, who decided that the chapter
had no right to any such tolls within church or
cemetery, “for anger and evil will whereof the said
dean and chapter by their ministers and servants,
ever since have put out all such merchants and
merchandize contrary and against the old rule and
use, and to the destruction of the fairs and markets.”<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
Moreover the canons proceeded to lock the doors
of a cloister adjoining the church which was according
to the citizens “a common way for the mayor
and commonalty” into the cathedral, and “a place
of prayer and devotion to pray for all souls whose
bones lay buried there.” It was in no sense, said
the ecclesiastics, a “common way” of the townspeople;
it was walled and glazed and had a chapter
house and library, and the canons were much offended
that “ungodly ruled people, most custumably young
people of the said commonalty within the said cloister
have exercised unlawful games as the top, ‘queke,’
‘penny prykke,’ and most at tennis, by the which
the walls of the said cloister have been defouled and
the glass windows all to brost, as it openly sheweth,
contrary to all good and ghostly goodness, and directly
against all good policy, and against all good rule within
the said cloister to suffer any such misruled people
to have common entry.” The mayor still asserted
however that “within time out of mind there was no
such cloister there but all open church here, and a
common way into the said church.” As to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
games, “the mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty say that
they by the law be not bound thereto to answer.”<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>Amid the endless and vulgar details of all this
intricate quarrel, Shillingford held fast to the principles
which he saw plainly were of the very essence
of any true municipal life. Charters of freedom were
of no use if in every question of trade, of police, of
finance, of public order, ecclesiastical privilege stepped
in and brought all government save its own to
an end. All discussions from first to last invariably
came back to the one central problem&mdash;the right of
arrest&mdash;and here the mayor was determined that no
persuasion should induce him to abate one jot of
the city claims. He would give no assent to the
bishop’s arguments drawn from an alleged friendly
agreement which laid down that the town officers
should make arrests in the cemetery only, and that
they might not arrest there the canons or men wearing
the religious habit or their ministers and servants,
and steadfastly denied that any such writing
had ever been known or proved. Henceforth he
would not hear of concession or compromise;
“it would seem if I so did that I had doubt of our
right where I have right none,”<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> as he said to the
lord chief justice. When “my lord himself spake
darkly of right old charters,” and conjured him to
make an end of the matter, “and if I so did I
should be chronicled;” the mayor still remained
firm.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> “I held my own, I had matter enough.” He
was especially pressed in sundry points by the lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
chancellor, who as a learned man made merry over
the tale of Vespasian’s connexion with the city, a
piece of history upon which the mayor did not greatly
care to dwell;<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> and as former canon of Exeter cathedral
he was ready at times to laugh over the stories
of his Exeter days, and of the exciting arrests and
lively disputes which he so well remembered; “all
it was to tempt me with laughing cheer,” said the
watchful mayor.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> “At the last fell to matter of
sadness, and they spake of God’s house, St. Peter’s
Church of Exeter, and my lord spake of his house,
his hall, and the justice the same, how loath they
would be to make arrests therein, and said that St.
Peter’s Church was God’s house and His hall, &amp;c.,
and made many reasons to bring in absence of
arrests.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> They were answered as God would give
us grace.” The chancellor, as was natural from his
old association with the chapter, was especially
anxious to bring about a compromise favourable to
the church. He proposed that the city should have
the view of frankpledge over the whole city and
precincts, and should only make arrests ordered by
that court; and on the other hand the bishop “to
have his courts of his own tenants and to hold pleas
of greater sum than the court baron, forty shillings,
and spake of forty marks. Upon this mean he
sticked fast and thought it was reasonable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
ever asked of me divers times what I would say
thereto, all as I conceived to tempt me, and to
consent to a mean; and then I said, my lord, if it
please you, ye shall have me excused to answer,
for though methought that it were a mean reasonable
I dare not say yea, though I have power, for
the matter toucheth a great commonalty as well as
me, and so that I dare not say unto time that I
have spoke with my fellowship at home.”<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>For two years the discussions dragged on at one
place or another, till in 1448 an agreement was made
between Town and Church “by mean and mediation
of Thomas Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, and of Sir
William Bonville, knight,” and was four days later
(Dec. 16th, 1448) confirmed by the Chief Justice of
Common Pleas and another Judge. Exeter was
forgiven the enormous damages demanded by the
convent for the illegal arrests made by the town
officers within the precincts two years before&mdash;damages
amounting to £1,000, or a sum which
must have been equal to many years’ revenue of
the borough. For the rest the arbitration reasserted
in definite terms the division of authority
against which the city had so vigorously protested.
The bishop was left absolute lord of his fee. All
he desired&mdash;court baron, leet, view of frankpledge,
a rule without any disturbance of the mayor, bailiffs,
or coroners of the city, and with absolute freedom
from distress or arrest, was secured to him for
ever. He was only bound not to arrest any of the
mayor’s subjects in his precincts. As for the mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and commonalty they retained their ancient powers
in the city, but might make no arrests on church
lands. They might summon the bishop’s tenants
to keep the watch in their turn, and might fine
them if they refused, making a levy on their goods
found <i>without the Fee</i>. In the king’s taxes and the
city murage the church tenants were to take their
share, but it was to be raised by their own officers.
Lastly the mayor and bailiffs might have their
maces carried before them in the cathedral precincts
without disturbance.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> It was decreed that
no new charters were to disturb this arrangement;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
and hence forward the chapter guarded its privileges
with accurate solicitude.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>This “final” settlement gave to the city all that
any lawyer could have given it in the fifteenth century,
for lawyers after all could only declare the legal
principles that had been laid down in times when
the power in the State had been very differently
balanced, and the fashioning of the law in these
matters had lain in the hands of ecclesiastics. Statesmen
like the chancellor moreover could discuss the
question with philosophic calm; in the greater concerns
of national administration the problem between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Church and State had been decided for them in the
days of Henry the Second, by methods as rough
and ready as any which burghers of later times had
attempted; and they therefore now looked at the
townspeople’s troubles from afar off. The pressure of
difficulty had changed, and whereas it was the people
who had once gained profit from ecclesiastical immunities,
while kings and statesmen had to bear the
violence of the battle for order and the authority of
government, now the brunt of the fight fell on
the common folk, while rulers at Westminster sat
at ease and calmly recounted the old arguments
which their greater predecessors had found it
necessary to repudiate utterly three hundred years
before.</p>

<p>For the experience of Exeter was by no means
exceptional or rare, and if we turn to the history of
Canterbury or Norwich we find the same record of
centuries of passionate strife, with fire and pillage
and murder and costly processes of law ending in
yet fiercer antagonism. To multiply instances would
prove wearisome repetition, but considering the great
importance which these questions had for the mediæval
burgher, and the gravity of their results in
later history, it may be well to note in the history of
another town how, with a few superficial differences,
the fundamental difficulty was always the same.</p>

<p>In Canterbury, as we might expect, things were
yet more complicated than in Exeter, and the
situation of the citizens was one of considerable
perplexity. From almost every considerable holding
in the town some religious corporation claimed a rent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
charge which had to be deducted in the city accounts.
The Convent of S. Gregory declared itself to be in the
shire of Kent and outside the city bounds, and as late
as 1515 asserted its freedom by refusing to take its
share in the payment of a subsidy; when the mayor
levied a distress the convent sued him for trespass,
and a long and costly lawsuit followed.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The hospitals
of S. Nicholas at Harbledown and of S. John
Northgate were exempted by royal charter from
all tallages, aids, and contributions; and their lands
and woods in the hundred of Westgate were made
free from contribution for the defence of the coast.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
But these trifling grievances scarcely came into
notice beside the troubles caused by greater ecclesiastical
powers&mdash;the Priory of Christ Church, the Convent
of S. Augustine’s, and the Archbishop. The old
dissensions that had once disturbed their common
harmony had all been appeased by means of a complete
separation between the property and jurisdiction
of the Archbishop and the Convent of Christ
Church, which had been finally arranged somewhere
about 1260; and by an agreement which was concluded
about the end of the fourteenth century, between
S. Augustine’s and Christ Church, as to their
special disputes about ecclesiastical prerogatives, or
about the rights of the convents on the high sea, on
the quay at Fordwich, in the common meadows at
Sturry, and in the neighbouring harbours of Sandwich
which belonged to Christ Church, and Stonor which
belonged to S. Augustine’s.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> But in the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
peacemaking the city was left out, and the city had
its own separate grievances against archbishop, abbot,
and prior.</p>

<p>I. For the archbishop possessed certain rights which
were exceedingly inconvenient to the borough. In
case of a quarrel, he could refuse to ordain Canterbury
men, to confirm Canterbury children, or to allow the
offices of the Church to sick people, unless the townsfolk
swore to obey him in all things. He could forbid
his tenants to join in the great city festival of the
Translation of S. Thomas. He was known to have
cited 140 of the chief citizens to appear before him
at Charing, twelve leagues away from Canterbury
and without proper victuals, whereas by custom they
should be summoned to appear in their own cathedral.
Such were the complaints which the struggling
town had to make in 1290.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> His borough of Staplegate,
just opposite the palace and within the city
boundaries, was surrounded by a wall and exempt from
the jurisdiction of both the city and the county;<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
even the royal writ did not run in it. Since his
tenants in Westgate and Wingham were free from the
town authorities, when Westgate men took to building
their houses so near the river that the stream was
driven against the city walls with such force as to make
them fall, the town was helpless to check the evil, and
complained as loudly of the wrong in 1467<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> as it had
done in 1290. Or when Wingham men intercepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
for their market the provisions which were on the
road to Canterbury, and thus both diminished the
tolls of provisions taken at the Canterbury gates and
increased the price of food, the corporation had no
remedy, for the archbishop’s right to hold a market
at Wingham could not be denied.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Moreover the
Whitstaple fishermen, also tenants of the archbishop,
were supported by him in 1431 in their claim of a
right to sell fish in the city free from any toll save a
farthing for each person; and in 1481 when the
fishwives refused to pay toll or to sell in a new
market built by the citizens, the townsfolk had no
resource save to make up out of their own pockets the
losses of the tax collector during these troubles.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> We
have the record of yet another quarrel in 1480, when
the archbishop seized the tithe of the aftermath in
the King’s Mead, upon which the mayor immediately
collected his posse, marched to the meadow about a
mile distant, and there ordered sixteen pennyworth
of wine to be served out all round for the refreshment
of his troop.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>II. With the Abbot of S. Augustine’s the city
had disputes concerning mill and market. For the
“Abbot’s Mill” was supposed to injure the City
Mill, which lay a little higher up the stream, and
the grievance was so serious that in 1415 iron-topped
stakes were driven into the river bed by a
board of inspectors to mark the highest level for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
water at the Abbot’s Mill, so that the fall might be
deep enough for water coming from the wheel of the
City Mill.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> As late as 1522 there was a consultation
between the town body and “Milord of S. Austin’s”
about the fish-market, which ended in a friendly
manner with the present of a conger-eel and a bottle
of Malmsey to the abbot.</p>

<p>The chief quarrel however was as to the exact
limits of the abbot’s authority as defined by an
agreement drawn up in the thirteenth century, and
carefully copied out anew by the city clerk in the
fifteenth century; and the nice point under discussion
during many generations was whether the abbots,
under pretext of infang-theoff, should persist in arresting
evildoers in Longport, which was the King’s
highway and under the jurisdiction of his assignees,
the corporation of Canterbury, but which ran for its
whole length through the abbey lands.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> It was only
after 1475 that the dispute seems to have come to an
end, when the abbot’s gallows at Chaldensham were,
by the consent of the community and of the convent,
broken to pieces. A Baron of the Exchequer and
the Recorder of London chosen to arbitrate between
the burghers and the monks, were welcomed at Canterbury
with a fee for their pains, lodged at the Austin
Friars, entertained sumptuously at the town’s expense
with lavish supplies of choice food and drink,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
served with three meals a day, “fractio jejunii, jantaculum,
et cœna,” till finally on a certain afternoon
the monks and the corporation met to drink together
in honour of the final peace, and the ambassadors set
out on their journey homewards, treated to refreshments
at every stage from the parting cup at Canterbury
to the farewell drink at Newgate. In 1478
they delivered their arbitration at Westminster, and
there was a fresh series of “potationes” to celebrate
the settlement.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>III. The Abbot of S. Augustine’s was indeed a far
less formidable neighbour than the Prior of Christ
Church, between whom and the city there lay centuries
of angry controversy. With him also there was
of course the usual quarrel about the administration
of justice. The Prior had his own gallows, where
men were hung for sheep-stealing as well as for
murder, and when the see of Canterbury was vacant
convicted prisoners who “pleaded their clergy”
were handed over to him as their ordinary&mdash;an
arrangement which evidently must have been a
source of much bitter feeling on the part of the
townspeople; in 1313, for example, out of nine men
who were convicted by a jury in the Assize court
of stealing and murder and who all pleaded their
clergy, seven purged themselves before the ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
judge and were set free.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Moreover the
cathedral was turned into a sanctuary, where criminals
fled from the just judgment of their fellow
citizens. In 1425 Bernard the goldsmith, a stranger
from over sea, escaped from the city prison and fled
to the cathedral church, followed by the bailiffs
and a wild mob of townsmen. As he crouched
within the rails of the new monument put up to
Archbishop Chicheley, the mob thrust their arms
between the bars, seized him and beat him with
sticks hidden in their sleeves, and at last tore him
out of the enclosure, carried him into the nave, and
would have dragged him back to gaol, save for the
sudden interference of the commissary, who with his
followers drove them back and rescued the prisoner
from their hands.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>So also the question of taxes caused much wrangling.
Christ Church, which owned within the franchise
£200 of rent and five acres of land,<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> claimed to be
free from any contribution for maintaining the walls
of the city<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> after their circuit had been completed by
Archbishop Sudbury and left to the people’s care;
and this dispute was not settled till 1492, when the
convent, having got possession of a part of the wall,
undertook to keep that section of it in repair.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
With regard to the costs of levying soldiers for
the royal service<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> the citizens decided in 1327<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
to charge a part of this tax on lands held by the
convent. The tax seems to have been required
only from property in the city, and the archbishop
was inclined to give way after discussion with his
counsel, “however much those of our Church may
wish to do otherwise,” but the prior resolutely held
out and got a letter of special protection from the
King for Church property.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> At this the city was
stirred to the utmost fury. The people held a
meeting in Blackfriars’ churchyard, and passed a
resolution that if the convent still refused they would
break their windows in Burgate, disable their mills,
drive their tenants out of their houses; that they
would allow no one to give, sell, or lend meat or
drink to monks, and would seize carts and horses
carrying food from their manors and sell them in the
market; that they would arrest any monk coming
out of the monastery into the city and take his
clothes and property; that the monastery should be
cut off from the world by a deep trench dug in front
of its gate, and that no pilgrim should be allowed to
enter the cathedral until he had taken an oath not to
make the smallest offering. Finally every man at the
meeting swore that he would have from S. Thomas’s
shrine a gold ring for a finger of each hand.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> The
threat of interference with their pilgrims was a
serious matter to the convent, since the whole charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of providing for the comfort and safety of the
pilgrims lay with the mayor. Not only was it his
office to see that sufficient food was laid up in the
city for the pilgrims and to have all the special
directions which he judged necessary for their victuals
and lodgings set forth on a post which stood before
the court hall, but he was further responsible for
keeping order among them, and there were occasions
when travellers would set out on their journey with
just apprehension unless, as happened at Lydd,
official messengers from the town were sent before
to Canterbury to arrange that its pilgrims might
come and go in safety without danger of arrest, and
won favour of the mayor’s wife by the gift of a quart
of malmsey.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> The corporation had in fact power to
make a visit to the shrine so difficult and unpleasant
as seriously to affect the flow of offering to the treasury
of the saint, and this at a time when the anxiety of
the convent about profits was heightened by the
pressing demands of the Papal Court for a share in
the spoils of its great Jubilee festivals.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> Money quarrels
in fact never failed on either side, and at the very
end of the fifteenth century it would seem that
Cardinal Morton saw in the old feuds a chance for
making Canterbury pay its full tribute to the royal
treasury; when in 1494 he issued demands for aid in
money or in men for the Scotch war he seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
sent several blank copies of the summons to his friend
Prior Selling to be filled up by him and issued to
corporations and citizens whom he thought rich
enough to pay. Probably in his directions to the
tax-gatherer Prior Selling did not forget old enemies
of the convent.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>The quarrel as to the town market also lasted on
throughout the fifteenth century. There the city
magistrates had indeed undisputed control, but it was
not always easy to enforce their control on the clever
people of the convent. Sometimes the monks attempted
to escape from the regulations and tolls of
the burgesses by sending to buy their fish at the
seaside; and the townsmen protected themselves by
seizing any fish so bought on its way to the priory.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
Other questions arose as to houses belonging to
Christ Church which opened inwards on the precincts
but had windows looking outwards on the
market-place in Burgate just outside the priory
gate, from which houses shutters and windows
could be let down for the inhabitants to display their
wares on market-day, whereat the town was doubly
aggrieved both by losing the rent of stalls and by
seeing the increasing rent of the houses pass away
into the convent treasury. At last in 1493 convent
and city sought to make a final settlement of the
question. The boundaries of the monastery were
defined, including many houses of laymen, and within
these limits the town renounced all jurisdiction except
over houses and shops which had doors or windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
opening on the street; while the convent was allowed
to distrain on any houses that belonged to it in the
city. But in 1500 the quarrel broke out with intenser
bitterness, and the mayor violently shifted the market
from the prior’s gate to the open space near the city
church, so that no house held by the convent should
have the advantage of opening out upon it. Then
ecclesiastical tenants refused to sell in the new market,
and city stall-holders treated the convent servants
with little courtesy. The citizens fell on the caterer
of Christ Church as he was carrying a halibut he had
bought from the market to the priory gate, and took
it from him, “contrary to all right and good conscience;”
and when the prior sent to the seaside for
fish, it was seized at the entrance of the town by the
citizens, “disappointing in the same the brethren of
the place of their dinners.”<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> The prior brought his
grievances before the London courts, upon which the
whole town took up the question with ardour, and the
burgesses collected a voluntary subscription to defend
their cause. The mayor was charged with the
conduct of the suit in London. Ten or twelve
citizens were perpetually riding backwards and
forwards and hanging about the courts, and the
usual expenses entered in the town records for drink,
supper, horse-meat, hire of horses to Rochester and
hire of barges and cloaks for the travellers from thence
to London, down to “threepence paid at Sittingbourne
in washing of my shirts.”<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Master Poynings, being at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
last commissioned by the King to take evidence on
the spot, was entertained at a splendid banquet, and
finally an exemplification of the market was sent up
to the King’s Council in London. In 1501 a new
messenger from the King “came to the city and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
tarried not because of death,<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> but spake with Mr.
Mayor at S. Andrew’s Church, the which showed him
the market and so he departed to Dover,” followed by
a messenger of the mayor hurrying after him with
presents of fish, game, poultry, and wine. Then new
ambassadors were sent from the city to the King at
Richmond, and the paying of fees, and costs for eating
and drinking went on merrily. But the citizens won
the day in the end, for the Canterbury market is still
held by S. Andrew’s Church and was never brought
back to the priory gate.</p>

<p>Even the control of the river brought its troubles,
for whenever a question arose as to embanking and
straightening the bed of the stream, the prior and the
mayor met in the meadows about Chatham with their
followers and carried on consultations refreshed by the
usual supply of meat and drink. Business however
was done at these parties, and the river turned from
its meandering course from one side of the valley to
the other into the straight channel in which it now
flows.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> The question of the mills was less easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
settle, with the dependent problems as to damming
the water and dredging the shallows. A settlement
made in 1431 to prevent the injury of the city mill
failed to end disputes, and in 1499 the prior dug a
trench which drew away the water from it, upon
which the citizens destroyed the trench and proceeded
to make a dam for the conservation of the
water running to their mill. The prior in his turn cut
the dam; whereupon the mayor called out his posse to
fight the matter out in the meadows by the river,
apparently routed the enemy’s forces, seizing their
arms, and the next day in his wrath removed the
market to its new place, as we have seen.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>So ended the fifteenth century in Canterbury amid
a storm of invective and free fighting. The mayor
protested that the prior, in addition to all his other
crimes, had taken away the mace from the city
serjeant, and had allowed the city ditch to be befouled.
The prior retorted by accusing the mayor
of riotous conduct, and breaking of boundaries and
building of bridges and diverting of water-courses
to his damage, and not only this, but of having for
malice and grudge to the prior and convent broken
the old custom of the citizens’ gathering at Christmas
at the tomb of Sudbury to pray for his soul
for the great acts he had done for the city, so that
they now withdrew their prayers from thence to
hold their service under the prison house called
Westgate. Indeed they even refused to join the
noblemen who brought the King’s offering to S.
Thomas at the Christmastide feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>As usual, however, all this mighty turmoil ended in
nothing. The mayor was indicted by the convent for
riot, and the verdict of the jury went against him,
but no particular result seems to have followed; and
though the persevering prior then had the case
brought before the Star Chamber in 1501, it was
passed over for want of leisure.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>Practically the same story was repeated at Canterbury
as at Exeter and in every other city where
there was a similar conflict.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> Money and skill and
labour and passion were expended without measure,
and finally the courts adjudged that all must remain
as it had been when the municipality scarcely existed
three hundred years before, an order which statesmen
possibly thought the safest course in the presence
of opposing forces, neither of whom was strong
enough to win, and neither of whom could dare to
lose. But this was not the end of the matter.
Through these three hundred years the towns had
gathered strength, perfected their machinery of
government, and realized their own might. Wealthy,
highly organized, very centres of rationalism in
politics and common sense in business, their controversy
with the Church, singularly free as it was
from theological pre-occupation, was inevitably in
all questions of temporal government more keen and
resolute in the fifteenth century than ever before.
It was vain to renew attempts in one town after
another to appease irreconcilable quarrels by arbitrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
and compromises which left the real problem
untouched, and the century before the Reformation
was everywhere a time of restless dissatisfaction, and
of spasmodic revolts against the alien ecclesiastical
settlements which throve on the town’s wealth, and
could never be absorbed into the town’s life. For
a little space matters hung in the balance, and then
came the crash of the Reformation. In the bitterness
of feeling that grew out of the long struggle of the
burghers, we have a measure of that temper of virile
independence which created the boroughs of the
Middle Ages; and as we stand now under the walls of
Canterbury Cathedral and see its glory shattered and
its carved work broken in pieces, we may well wonder
whether in that great ruin there was no other
motive at work than the fanaticism of a religious
awakening.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">CONFEDERATION</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fact that the English burghers took so impatiently
the one hindrance that lay in their path to
independence and supremacy is itself a proof of the
habit of prosperity and success which they were
accustomed to accept as part of their natural heritage
in the pleasant place where their lot had fallen. How
little they had at any time to reckon with opposition
is obvious from the striking fact that they never found
themselves compelled to form any kind of union or
alliance for common purposes. Here the story of
English boroughs is in vivid contrast to that of the continental
towns. The powerful confederations formed
in European countries by towns battling against
tremendous odds to protect their commerce, liberty,
and law, had no parallel among the comparatively
peaceful and regular conditions of English life, where
self-government was so easily attained, and where
trade was so generally secure, that the necessity
never arose for the creation of any such associations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Towns on the royal demesne stood in no need of any
combined effort to defend their freedom; and the
towns on ecclesiastical lands or feudal estates that
had grievances to complain of were few, scattered,
and subject to so many different lords that combination
among them would have been wholly
impossible. Organized common action was therefore
practically unknown among the English boroughs;
for the loose tie of affiliation which bound together
communities of which one had adopted the charter
and copied the customs of another was a bond so
slight as to be scarcely recognized,<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> and implied no
mutual obligations whatever. In moments of excited
strife or rapid constitutional growth a borough
might undoubtedly become fired by the example of a
near neighbour, or catch the contagion which spread
from some community more advanced in its experiments
and daring in its pretensions; but these
movements of sympathy, of voluntary affiliation, of
emulation, never resulted in any kind of federation or
alliance. For the developement of its liberties each
borough was ultimately left to depend only on its
own resources; while such societies as were constituted
in later days in England for trading purposes
took the form of federations of men not of
towns.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>There was but one exception to this general rule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and in the Confederation of the Cinque Ports we have
the single illustration in England of an association of
towns created and maintained for common interests.
From Seaford in Sussex to Brightlingsea in Essex
ports and villages were bound together into one
society. To the original group of the Five Ports&mdash;Hastings,
Sandwich, Dover, Romney, and Hythe,
whose alliance probably reaches back to the time when
the English learned war and commerce from Danish
masters&mdash;the two Ancient Towns, Winchelsea and
Rye, had been added immediately after the Norman
Conquest; and what with the desire of these seven
to divide their burdens of taxation and war charges
with the neighbouring villages, and the readiness of
the villages on their side to seek admission to the
Port privileges,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> an association had in course of time
been evolved consisting of seven head Ports with
eight corporate and twenty-four non-corporate members,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
all gathered under the rule of the Lord Warden.
To the last they bore traces of foreign influences in
the name of Jurats by which they called their “portmen,”
and of Barons which they gave to their
“freemen.” But amid the curious vicissitudes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
their history, and the odd incidents of their ownership
in times when it seemed natural and simple
to grant away the very frontier defences of
England to Norman counts and Breton dukes and
abbots of Fécamp and monks of Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> and in
later days after English kings had realised the
advantages of themselves owning the main gates by
which their country opened on the European world,<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
these communities remained firmly united under their
federal government.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> The King’s writ did not run
in the Ports unless it bore the seal of the Lord
Warden. Exempt by charter from serving on
juries, assizes, or recognizances outside their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
territory,<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> the freemen could be impleaded only in
their own courts.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> No prisoner from the Ports could
be summoned by the Judges to Westminster, and
in the case of an express order from the King “some
demur should be made to the first mandate till it
be known with certainty it is his pleasure,”<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> while
on the other hand any stranger who committed a
crime within their liberties might be claimed by the
mayor and jurats from any lordship in the realm,
even from the King himself.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> They had even, after
a fight which lasted for generations, successfully
resisted all attempts to bring their local jurisdiction
within the general judicial system of the kingdom,
and the Justices Itinerant were shut out from crossing
their boundaries or sitting at their Court of Shepway.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>
Ancient privileges were jealously guarded. “New
Acts of Parliament,” they said, “ought not to alter the
free customs.”<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> No deodand was given to the Crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
“because it never was the custom here.”<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> If an
ecclesiastical officer came from Canterbury to make
an inventory of the goods of a Sandwich man who
had died without a will, he was not allowed to act
because it was contrary to the ancient customs
and liberties of the town.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Their corporate dignity
was officially recognized on great occasions of State,
such as the coronation of a King or the consecration
of an Archbishop, when the envoys of the
Cinque Ports were treated with special honour and
sat at the right hand table in the hall; and each
of the Ports in turn sent representatives to carry
the canopy over the newly-crowned King, and after
the ceremony to bear it back with its silk hangings,
its spears, and its silver bells, as the town’s spoils.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>As to the idea or principle which held this
society of towns together and the purpose which it
was meant to serve, the definition given by a
minister of the Crown would probably have been
very different from that given by a baron of the
Ports. To a statesman the confederation of the Cinque
Ports was organized in the interests of the whole
country, and maintained as the bulwark of national
safety; and the policy of West Saxon rulers, of
Danish conquerors, of Norman kings, of Angevin
statesmen, had all alike aimed at the increasing
of its public utility. Holding their posts in the
first line of defence against invasion, the Cinque
Port towns were bound to keep a sufficient number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
of men within their walls for defence against the
enemy, and watch that inhabitants were not driven
away by the imposition of undue local taxes; they
had to bear heavy costs for ordnance, ammunition,
fortifications; to set a nightly watch in every
borough and at every dangerous creek or harbour;
to have armed forces ready to meet the first brunt
of attack, while their citizens might expect in time
of war to see their houses sacked and burned
again and again. They had to provide every year
fifty-seven ships and 1,197 men with provisions for
the defence of the kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> and if these were not
enough in number or in size greater ones and more
were required of them. If they hesitated to comply
with such demands, or if they were shown not to
have held firm against the invader, they were
roughly reminded of the bargain on the terms of
which alone all their privileges were held, and
saw their charters and franchises seized into the
King’s hand.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>This view of the organization of the Cinque Ports
for the public service was visibly represented in the
rule of the King’s officer, the Lord Warden of the
Ports and Constable of Dover Castle. His authority
the men of the Cinque Ports were never for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
allowed to forget; and the Lieutenant of Dover or his
messengers, continually riding round the Ports with
message or proclamation or to “make inquisition,”<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>
were everywhere helped on their way by dinners,
breakfasts, pipes of wine, or a play at the public
expense. From Dover came proclamations “warning
us of the Danes”; ordering “that no man should
quarrel with other for none old sores”; commanding
“to arrest the men who came from beyond sea without
leave and without billets”; or to seize ships
for crossing over to Flanders; calling out vessels
“to watch the sea”; or to serve the King in siege or
battle during the French war; summoning men “to
keep the Castle of Dover”; or decreeing the amount
of benevolences to be paid to the King.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> The
subjection of the whole confederation to his rule was
publicly recognized every year in the Court of
Shepway, when at his summons there came from
every port the mayor and a little group of jurats
carrying with them the required gifts and dues, wine
and swans and fish and spices to furnish breakfast
for officials and suitors at the court; or costly offerings
to soften the hearts of wardens and judges, and
induce them on their first entering into office to look
favourably on their subjects. Before them as they
sat on either side of the Warden on the open plain
near Lympne<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> proclamation was made as to the taxes
to be raised by the confederation, the special military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
services required of the freemen, or the new decrees
issued by the Government; and special offences
against the Crown were judged. A whole community
might be charged with a breach of the King’s peace,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
or an aggrieved corporation made application that
officers of the Ports should be sent to help in the
arrest and punishment of some stranger who had committed
a crime in their town; and prisoners from the
various towns accused of coining false money, treason,
or counterfeiting the King’s seal,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> were tried, and if
found guilty were forthwith tied on a sledge, drawn
round the circuit of Shepway, and hanged on the
spot.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>Nor did the authority of the Warden end at
Shepway. As Constable of the Castle he had his
court-martial in Dover.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> As Admiral he could order
a “quest of the Admiralty” to be held on the
sea-shore, or perhaps at some one of the Ports which
had offended against the laws of the confederation&mdash;a
calamity which the town at once sought to avert
by negociations and bribes “that he should not hold
the court.” As Chancellor he issued precepts and
summonses as to the services to be performed by
the Ports in return for their privileges, and exercised
in his court of chancery the complicated jurisdiction
that gradually arose out of these records. There
were moments when the King was stirred to a
recollection of his sovereignty&mdash;moments when the
towns had pushed independence too far, or when the
treasure in the royal coffers had fallen low; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
from Westminster a writ of enquiry would come as
to the privileges of the Ports, delegates were
summoned from the various towns to appear before
the Warden, and might find themselves kept many
days and nights at Dover<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> while “inquisition was
made for the King.” Sometimes they were ordered
to assemble on the sea-shore. Sometimes the Warden
came down the steep path of the castle hill to the
tiny church of S. James, set in the first little reach
of level ground below the walls of the fortification,
and there the jurats came up to meet him from their
lodgings in the town below, and after days of discussion
probably returned home with heavy news of
fines to be levied for buying a new charter, or for
getting the confirmation of some doubtful privilege.</p>

<p>In the authority of the Warden we see the view
held at Westminster about the uses of the Cinque
Ports and the main object of their existence. To the
people on the other hand the association had another
and wholly different character. So completely was
all the business of the Warden’s court at Shepway
looked on by the portsmen as the King’s affair, and
so slight was their sense of participation in it, that
they presently gave up attending it altogether, leaving
the Warden at last to preside in solitary state. In
course of time even the ancient site was abandoned,
and instead of the annual assembly at Shepway the
president only summoned an occasional court of
appeal to be held at Dover,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> and there, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
by a group of lawyers to advise him, sat on the chalk
cliff fronting the castle to hear certain cases immediately
touching the King’s interest.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Meanwhile the
barons of the Ports had their own tradition of
independence and self-government; and the popular
belief as to the object and meaning of the confederation
was embodied in another court which sat
on the Broad Hill, near Romney&mdash;a court where the
Lord Warden had no seat.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It was there that the
whole interest of the people centred, as turning their
backs on the King’s courts and leaving him to conduct
through the Lord Warden the matters which were his
peculiar business, they occupied themselves with the
management of their own special affairs. For to the
fisherman of the coast the confederation of the villages
was in its origin and working simply a great trading
company of the Ports for the protection of their staple
business, the herring fishery, and for the preservation
of their ancient customs of harbourage and sale on
the strand at the mouth of the Yare&mdash;a matter which
became of absorbing importance when their monopoly
was threatened by the fishermen of Yarmouth, so that
from the time of John onwards they could only preserve
their interests by ceaseless vigilance and by
costly appeals to King and Parliament, and Council.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
In the eyes of the barons therefore the great assembly
of the confederation was that which yearly met to
discuss the business of the Yarmouth fair. And
this was in the strictest sense a court of the people
themselves, summoned only by common consent,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>
presided over by the chief magistrate of each Port
in turn, and in which every town was represented
by its mayor or bailiff, three elected jurats, and three
commons. The sheltered harbour of Romney formed
a sort of natural centre of the Ports, and the
delegates met for business on the Broad Hill or
Bromhille of Dymchurch close by, whence they
possibly took the name of Brodhull, a name which in
later days when the first site was forsaken and
forgotten and the delegates met in Romney itself,
became changed into “Brothyrhill” or Brotherhood.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>On the first day of meeting the business, as befitted
an association for trading purposes which dated
back to the time when the herring fishery was the
staple trade of the Ports, was invariably the Yarmouth
fair, and the court heard the report of the bailiffs of
the last fair who stood bare-headed before them, and
elected their successors who were to govern the
coming fair.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> But other interests had grown up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
round the assembly hill. The seafaring population,
masters and mariners of trading barges, saw in the
union of Ports the power which regulated the relations
of seamen on either side of the Channel.
To the taxpayers it was a voluntary association for
the equitable adjustment of their burdens. And all
the inhabitants alike recognized its importance for
maintaining against lords of other franchises the
privileges which had been granted them in return
for their services.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>On the great day when the Yarmouth fair was
under discussion the Court of Brotherhood sat alone;
but on the following days when other work was to be
done&mdash;the distribution between the various towns of
the taxation<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> ordered at Shepway, the discussion of
commercial relations,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> the care of the common corporate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
privileges of the confederation<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>&mdash;the Court of
Brotherhood was joined by the Court of Guestling,
probably a descendant of the ancient Hundred Court
once held in the old town of Gestlinges near the
border-line of Kent and Sussex.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> To this court each
town might send the mayor, two jurats, and two
commoners; so that if all the delegates came the
number of the united assemblies would be seventy-seven;
as a matter of fact however in the time of
Henry the Sixth the business was done by about
thirty members.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> All the important affairs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Cinque Ports practically lay in their hands, and their
decisions, registered as Acts of the Brodhull by the
Common Clerk of the Cinque Ports,<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> became the law
of the whole confederation.</p>

<p>Constantly reminded of their ancient covenant and
confederation by imminent perils, arduous exertions
and recurring taxes, trained to habits of vigilance
and mutual support, the Cinque Ports kept a jealous
watch against the slightest infraction of the privileges
of their united body. But there was one
matter with which the confederation had nothing
whatever to do. Subject to a variety of jurisdictions,
some of them depending on the King, some on the
Archbishop, some on a bigger neighbouring town,
the special liberties of each borough had been developed
under very different conditions; and the whole
association took no heed of the defence of the
liberties of any single Port against its lord, or the
enlargement of the privileges of any one member
of their society as apart from the whole.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> The
corporate existence of the united Cinque Ports was
a thing altogether apart from the corporate existence
of each town within it; and indeed combination for
any purpose of securing local liberties would have
been out of the question in a confederacy where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
certain outward uniformity was but the screen of
endless diversity, and towns bound together by
special duties and privileges were widely separated
from one another in all the conditions of government.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
This is very evident if we compare the
situation of Sandwich and Romney&mdash;much more so if
we consider the position of any of the subordinate
members of the Ports.</p>

<p>I. For many centuries Sandwich belonged to the
monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, and so long
as it was a humble little port powerful kings like
Eadgar, Cnut, Henry the First, and Henry the
Second had been content to have it so, and with
indifferent acquiescence confirmed the monastic rights
over the town. But when in the course of time
Sandwich became the port through which almost
the whole of the continental trade with England
passed, when its commerce and revenue increased
till it stood far before Dover in importance,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> when
it was the chief harbour from which monarchs or
their ambassadors set sail for France, or from which
armies were sent forth in time of war, the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
began to look more seriously on the powers exercised
over it by the convent. An inquest ordered by the
Crown in 1227 reported in favour of the rights of
Christ Church over Sandwich, but by judicious bargaining
matters were finally arranged to the royal
satisfaction. At the price of a grant of lands in
Kent Edward the First bought the town, and though
the monks were still allowed certain lands and houses
free from municipal charges, and continued to receive
large sums from the wharf which was known as
Monkenkey with its crane for loading and unloading
ships,<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> and from the warehouses enclosing it, they
had to abandon their powers of taxing at discretion
all passengers and goods which crossed the bounds
of their territory.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>The Sandwich people had elected their own mayor
since the beginning of the thirteenth century; while
the royal interests were now looked after by a bailiff
appointed by the King.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> The townsmen however
kept a jealous watch over their own prerogatives.
When in 1321 Christ Church obtained a royal writ
to protect their property from the town taxes the
mayor and community refused to accept it because
it had been issued to the King’s bailiff, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
convent had to get a new writ.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> The bailiff’s powers
were carefully defined and kept in strict subordination
to those of the mayor. He collected the King’s dues
on goods brought into the town;<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> and it was he who
summoned the Hundred Court every three weeks to
meet in S. Clement’s church for view of frankpledge,
for pleas of land, questions of trespass, covenant,
debt, battery, bloodshed, and so on;<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> but he could
not hold the court without the mayor’s leave, nor
issue the summonses without the mayor’s orders.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> The
mayor for his part, if he was elected in S. Clement’s,
the church where the courts of the King were held,
had his seat of government in S. Peter’s, a church
that stood in the very centre of the town near the
Market-place and Common Hall, and in whose tower
the “Brande goose bell” hung which summoned
jurats and council men to the Common Assembly,
and rang out the hours for the market. He gathered
the Town Council for business to S. Peter’s, and in
S. Peter’s he sat every Thursday, and if business
required it on other days, to judge the people.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
Though the bailiff sat by his side and took part in
the business of the court, yet for offences against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the corporation the mayor and jurats might punish
the freemen “without consulting the bailiff or any
one else.”<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> To them belonged the entire regulation
of trade and the management of weights and measures,
for “the bailiff has nothing to do with this business.”
In no case was he allowed to interfere with
the town market; “that business belongs wholly
to the mayor and jurats,” the town customs declared.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>II. Sandwich in fact after it had passed to the Crown
enjoyed the full freedom common to the royal boroughs.
Bound only by allegiance to the general law of the
Cinque Ports it long maintained, as we shall see
later, a real independence of local life and a vigorous
democratic temper. But in Romney, in the very
port where the general assembly of the Cinque Ports
held its deliberations, the conditions were wholly
different. For a moment Romney like other towns
enjoyed its share of profits in the growing trade of
the country.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> The vintners engaged in the wine trade
rose from ten in 1340 to forty-eight who headed the
list of taxpayers in 1394; a new ward was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
after its cloth-dealer Hollyngbroke;<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> and merchants
from Prussia, Holland, Spain, and Flanders, citizens
of Bristol and of London, men from York and from
Dorset gathered within its walls. But a doom was
already on the town. As early as 1381 it had
begun its vain struggle against winds and tides
which silted up its port, destroyed its river
channel, and forced the Rother into a new bed.
Dutch and Flemish engineers had been called over
to make scientific sluices and barriers, and the
whole population had been summoned out to dig a
water-course, but in spite of incessant efforts the men
of Romney saw their trade driven into other ports.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>
The forty-eight vintners of 1394 had sunk to forty-four
in 1415, to five in 1431, and to one in 1449.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>
The burghers were being steadily ruined, and the
story of their decay remains registered in the long
lists of citizens who pledged their goods for debt,
giving in promise of payment saddles, cups, table-cloths,
helmets, cloths, which were delivered by the
creditor into the hands of the bailiff for keeping in
the Common Hall “according to custom,” and when
the day of payment had passed were appraised by
bailiff and jurats, often at half or a quarter of the
value at which they had been first declared, and
handed over to the creditor.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>Through good and evil fortune moreover Romney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
had to maintain a constant struggle for freedom.
The Archbishop of Canterbury was lord of the manor,
and appointed, subject to the ratification of the Lord
Warden, the bailiff of the town,<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> choosing if it seemed
good to him one of his own servants or squires, and
by a curious exception from the general law having
liberty to select a publican.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The bailiff fixed the
days for holding the market. He gathered in the
Archbishop’s dues, made sure that his share of any
wax, or wine, or goods cast on the shore from wrecks
was handed over, and that the jurats collected in
proper time the capons and swans and cygnets
which had to be sent to him, or that a porpoise
taken by the fishermen should be duly despatched to
the lord. The common horn sounded twice at the
market-place and at the cross to summon the people
to his court.</p>

<p>The question of government and of the bailiff’s
position was however always in debate. The “best
men of the town” rode to Archbishop Courtenay “to
know his will and what he proposed to do against
their liberties”; and for the following century the
Romney men were always on the watch, and heavily
taxed in gifts and bribes “to protect the liberty of
the town that the said lord might not usurp it.”<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
The bailiff’s power indeed was strictly limited. So
far as the administration of justice went he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
absolutely controlled by the twelve jurats who were
yearly elected “for to keep and govern the port and
town;”<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> and “in case the bailiff do other execution
than the sworn men have judged against the usage
of the town” they might fine him £10 to the commons.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>
But this was not enough. In 1395 the
jurats made suit to the Lord Archbishop to “put
his bailiwick into the hands of the community of
Romney at ferm,”<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> and for the century which followed
they were always seeking for some means of gaining
complete control of the government. For lack of
better security a simple expedient was discovered.
The townspeople allowed a custom to grow up that
the Archbishop should not be expected to appoint
a new officer every year, but that whoever was sent
to the town should be understood to hold his post
permanently. When in 1521 the prelate complained
that the jurats would not let his bailiff enter
Romney<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> they answered that when there was no
bailiff in the town the Archbishop might send a new
one, but that the accustomed bailiff who had been
admitted seven or eight years ago was still living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
and was “of good name and fame,” and so the place
was not void; moreover, they said, a bailiff must
make his appearance with certain formalities and
“be of good opinion,” but this new man had not
been sent with the proper forms. The fixity of
tenure<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> which the townsfolk thus raised to the
dignity of a “customary” right was a real guarantee
that the bailiff should no longer be a mere dependent
holding his post at the pleasure of a distant master,
trembling under the apprehension of hazarding his
employment by preferring the interests of the commonalty
to those of his lord, and only intent on heaping
up treasure against the day when his credit
and employment should come to an end. He became
more and more identified with the townsfolk
among whom he lived, and on whose approval he
was made dependent by their contention that he
should hold office so long as he was, in their opinion,
“of good name and fame.”</p>

<p>But the burghers were still dissatisfied with so
precarious a tenure of independence. There was a
proposal which came to nothing to unite the
bailiff and jurats of the town with the bailiff
and jurats of the marsh; but in 1484 the people
profited by the troubles of Richard’s reign to plan
a thoroughgoing revolution.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> They set up a
mayor for themselves, and sent to have a silver
mace made at Canterbury under the very
walls of the Cathedral precincts. The Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
called in the help of the Crown and the great people
of the London law courts, and after much battling
and negotiation the matter was ended before the
year was out by a Privy Seal being sent down to
Romney to depose the mayor. Before a generation
had passed away however the struggle broke out
again with new vigour, and in 1521 town and prelate
were again quarrelling over all the old grievances.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>The main point of the burghers’ argument was to
deny the Archbishop’s assertion that “the town is
all bishopric.” The jurats contended that “from all
time” they had had the privileges of one of the
capital Five Ports, that their grant of “streme and
strond” of the sea and all other rights came to
them from the King and not the Archbishop; and
that they held the greater part of their town directly
from the Crown,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> on which land the Archbishop
had no right to enter, and the commonalty had
rights of justice. So also the Archbishop had no
right to the marsh and pasturage of four hundred
acres which had once been creek and haven, but
had been left dry land since about 1380 by the
withdrawal of the sea a good half-mile from the town,
for this “void place” left by the main course of the
stream through the town belonged to the King.
Arguing therefore from this fiction of being on royal
soil the jurats went on to claim the popular control
of justice which was used in royal boroughs, and
frowardly kept the courts without the bailiff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
boldly asserting in their own defence that he
was at the best but a minister of the King’s
courts in Romney and not a judge; for if the town
courts were in fact courts of the King, they were
under the royal grants and charters which ordained
that mayor and jurats, or bailiff and jurats, <i>elected
by the people</i>, were to hold courts, hear pleas, and
have fines and amercements and other profits of
leets and law-days; and therefore since the bailiff of
Romney was not elected by the commons he was
clearly excluded and had nothing to do in the said
courts save as minister and executioner, and any
record of pleas before him was void. In times past,
they declared, he had merely been allowed to sit
among them by favour, and not of duty. The fines
raised at leets and law-days they claimed for the
town’s use, saying that these had only been given
to the most Reverend Father by the favour of the
jurats to obtain his good lordship; but that he had
never any right whatever to leet or law-day, fine or
amercement. So persistent were their protestations
of independence that it seems as though ultimately
the Archbishop’s heavy wrath settled down to rest on
the town. When Cranmer leased out the bailiwick
of Hythe to the townspeople,<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> he refused to give to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Romney a similar lease&mdash;a gift which it had begged
of Courtenay a hundred and fifty years before.
Cranmer’s lordship indeed came to an end at the
Reformation, but even then Romney was for a time
governed by its senior jurat, and it was not until
1563 that it seemed to have sufficiently purged its
iniquity, and that Elizabeth finally allowed its people
to elect a mayor.</p>

<p>III. From the instances of Sandwich and Romney
it is evident that the bond which existed between
the chief Ports only served certain definite ends, and
had no influence whatever on the developement of
local liberties or the intimate relations of a borough
to its lord. And if this was the case with the leading
Ports, still less was it possible for the subordinate
members of the confederation to look for aid in their
private controversies. Romney itself for example
in the midst of its struggle with the Archbishop
was engaged in a resolute effort to retain its own hold
over its dependent town of Lydd. There also the
Archbishop of Canterbury was lord of the manor,
both of the town and of a great part of the grazing
land round it known as Dengemarsh, in which lay the
fishing-station of Lydd, Denge Ness; while the rest
of Dengemarsh was divided between the Abbot of
Battle, the Castle of Rochester, and Christ Church,
Canterbury, all alike ready to raise at any time
questions of disputed rights. As far as the Archbishop
was concerned the townsmen had commuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
their services at his court of Aldington for a yearly
payment, and became “lords in mean” of their own
borough&mdash;possibly in the time of Henry the Sixth
when they first began formally to use the style of
Bailiffs, Jurats, and Commonalty of Lydd; but the
Archbishop’s seal with the mitre was still used in
deeds for selling or letting land.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>But Lydd was further subject to Romney as
“member of the Town and Port,” and in token of
this submission their custumal was kept at Romney.
If they wanted to ascertain their rights they had to
send a messenger to the superior town; and an entry
in the accounts of Lydd tells how the corporation
paid eightpence to “the servant of Romney bringing
authority of having again our franchise.” Romney
claimed to make awards on disputed questions,
interfered about the Lydd markets, and ordered inquisitions
as to whether they had been wrongfully
held.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Moreover as the inhabitants of Lydd “were
contributors to Romney before all memory,” their
officers had year after year to present themselves
before the jurats of Romney in the Church of S.
Nicholas carrying their accounts and such payments
as were demanded by their rulers.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> Even after the
men of Lydd had been given by Edward the First
the same liberties and free customs as the other
barons of the Cinque Ports, the sum of their taxes
was fixed by Romney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>Among many masters the corporation was kept in
a perpetual ferment. The boundaries of its territory
were not finally decided till 1462, and the quarrel
with Battle on this point kept lawyers and town
clerks busy hurrying backwards and forwards between
London and Lydd, or riding to Canterbury to
get the Abbot’s charter, or to Winchelsea to meet
the Abbot’s counsel.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> For a hundred years moreover
the town kept up the long struggle to free itself from
the supremacy of Romney. Already in 1384 deputations
from both the towns met in Dover to discuss
the terms of agreement between them with the
Warden, and from that time lawyers were kept
constantly at work, and a counsel seems to have been
permanently employed in London, besides the deputations
of bailiff, common clerk, and jurats sent
there as well as to Dover, Sandwich, or Canterbury,
and the messengers despatched with “courtesies” for
the Lieutenant, the Seneschal, or the Clerk of Dover
Castle, the Mayor and Clerk of Dover town, the Archbishop
of Canterbury and his steward, the Common
Clerk of Winchelsea and so on; while the salary
of the Town Clerk, Thomas Caxton, probably a brother
of the great printer, was raised again and again, so
as to secure the services of the most skilful lawyer
and able administrator in all the country round.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>
Even in a trifling matter of taxation it was not till
1490 that the town was able to make a composition
for a fixed yearly payment.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>IV. In the same way Sandwich had the mastery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the little town of Fordwich,<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> which lay fifteen miles
higher up the river and claimed dominion over a
tiny territory reaching back from the water’s edge
on either side as far as a man in a boat on the river
could throw an axe of seven pounds called “Taperaxe.”
The inhabitants elected every year a mayor,
treasurer, and jurats to govern them and preserve
the liberties of the town. The mayor with a black
knotted stick as badge of his office, held his court
of justice. He appointed every year four freemen
to act as arbitrators in case of trespass, and if any
townsman refused to accept their decision or tried to
carry the cause to another court, he was fined the
enormous sum of a hundred shillings, or thrown for
a year into the town prison, a filthy hole of nine
feet square which still exists. In capital cases the
mayor could give sentence of death, and order the
prosecutor if he won his suit to carry the condemned
criminal to the “Thefeswell” and himself throw him
into it with hands and feet tied, “knebent” as it
was called.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>Fordwich however had been granted by the Confessor
to S. Augustine’s, Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> The Abbot
owned the soil of the town; his bailiff lived within
its walls and presided over the Hundred Court which
he summoned by his officer “Cachepol”; he had his
own prison; he was entitled to fines and forfeitures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
from felons and fugitives; and he claimed certain
customs on all imports, and asserted a right to control
the fisheries of the river so as to supply his
monks at the fasting seasons.</p>

<p>The convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, owned
on the other hand a quay at the highest point to
which ships could pass up the river; to this quay
wine, alum, Caen stone, etc., were brought for the use
of the monastery, and endless quarrels were developed
out of its trading monopolies.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>As a member of the Port of Sandwich the town
was subject to certain regulations and taxations
which Sandwich had a right to impose. When the
chief Ports met to assess and distribute taxation
among themselves, the voice of the lesser members
of the confederation was never heard, and the dependent
towns had simply to pay such proportions
of the sum due as their masters ordered, and there
were naturally frequent signs of grumbling and dissatisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>
The severe protectionist laws which
the Fordwich people passed against Sandwich as to
the use of the common quay with the crane possibly
indicates some attempt at encroachment which it was
possible to resist as well as to resent.</p>

<p>Under the rude pressure of rival jurisdictions on
every side, and from which there was no escape, the
corporation needed constant vigilance in looking
after its own interests. Like every other town big
and little in the fifteenth century Fordwich made
careful research into the true limits of its chartered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
rights, and the clerk wrote out new copies of their
custumal and of the old record of their boundaries.
In the only point where they had a chance of success
its burghers fought with steady pugnacity for their
privileges. Protesting that they held a monopoly of
the quay where the ships were unloaded, they refused
the customs demanded by S. Augustine’s, claimed the
whole control of the river and of the three weirs
which were made every year at the beginning of the
fishing season, and at last forced a compromise which
left the convent only the produce of a single weir.</p>

<p>If the lesser members of the Ports which were
themselves corporate bodies, such as Lydd or
Fordwich, could expect from their superiors no help
in achieving independence, the non-corporate members
were yet more completely withdrawn from the
chance of assistance; for the seven great towns of
the association would have looked with little tolerance
on any revolt in their dependent villages.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Undoubtedly
the inhabitants of the Cinque Ports had
their full share of the democratic temper that ruled
in the trading towns of the eastern coast from the
Wash to the Channel. Rebellion was in the air; and
the labourers and miners of Kent and Sussex had an
evil reputation in the Middle Ages as being most prone
to civil dissensions, “as well for that they can hardly
bear injuries as for that they are desirous of novelties.”<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>
There was never a rising in which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
not the most eager partizans of the revolutionary side.
The men of Kent crowded after Cade. Hastings sent
eleven soldiers to help him; Rye begged for his
friendship; and Lydd sent its constable on horseback
to meet him, wrote him a letter of excuse for not
joining him, and presented him with a porpoise.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
When Warwick took up the cry of Cade they rallied
to his side; and when he brought back Henry the
Sixth in 1470 they again gave him support.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> In
the internal politics of the towns we meet the same
temper; and however obscure and insignificant were
the struggles of the Ports and of the humble villages
that gathered around them, they reveal to us the
militant spirit of self-assertion which was stirring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
every hamlet in England. But with this sturdy
spirit of municipal freedom the question of federal
organization had nothing whatever to do. We have
seen that the trading privileges won in early days
by the joint action of the towns were confined to the
supervision of the herring fair at Yarmouth, and
that the association never developed into a great
commercial league after the imposing pattern of the
towns of Picardy or of the Rhine. Still less did
the union resemble any of the federative republics
formed across the water in Ponthieu or the Laonnais
for mutual aid against the enemies of their peace or
liberties.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> There is no evidence that the confederation
of the Cinque Ports afforded to its members any
security of municipal freedom, or any extension of
the rights to be won from their several lords; and as
a matter of fact this group of favoured towns does
not seem to have made the slightest advance on other
English boroughs, either in winning an earlier freedom,
or in raising a higher standard of liberty. In
fact the history of the sixteenth century was to prove
that there was no more formidable opposition to
the growing democracies in the Kent and Sussex
towns than the respectable official company that
gathered at Romney and ate together the annual
feast of the Court of Brotherhood.</p>

The right of pit and gallows was never formally revoked.
The last case was under Charles I. (Rogers’s Agriculture and
Prices, i. 132). The gallows at Southampton stood on the common;
in Colchester at the end of East Street.</p>

The Inquisition de quo Warranto, Ed. I., proves that S.
Martin’s and other villages were under the jurisdiction of
Canterbury; inquests at these places were held by the city
coroner. York had a territory of 2,700 acres. (Agric. and Prices,
iv. 579.) The burgesses of Dorchester claimed the right to weigh
all goods within twelve miles of the town. A special statute
was passed in 1430 “that they shall not be disturbed of their
right,” in consequence of the Act of 1429 ordering weights and
measures in every town. (9th Henry VI. cap. vi.) Other
instances, such as Norwich, Nottingham, &amp;c., are too numerous
to give.</p>

The mariners of the Cinque Ports drew up treaties with
“French shipmen,” as to ransom for mariners, sailors, or fishing
boats that might be captured on either side; the people of the
coast were to be set free without charge, while “gentlemen” and
merchants were to pay whatever the captors chose to ask. The
shipowners and merchants of each port signed the compact; and
all the towns of the coast from Southampton to Thanet joined
the league. The document which was drawn up was handed
over to the keeping of the Lord Warden in Dover, and in case of
dispute messengers from the Ports rode there to see its provisions,
or to make a copy for their own guidance. Hist. MSS. Com.
v. 537-8; iv. i. 434.</p>

London was not apparently before other cities in the winning
of liberties. (Round, Geoffrey de Mandeville, 372.) There were

at the muster roll of 1311 there appeared eight men armed with
sword, bow, arrows, and knife; thirty-three with bows, arrows,
and knives; and over two hundred and thirty-five (besides some
names lost at the foot of the roll) with hatchets and knives. In
1371 the town was able to raise a body of archers for service
abroad; and under Edward the Sixth it sent fifty soldiers armed
with bills, swords, daggers, bows, and arrows, and paid each
soldier forty pence “for the King’s affairs into Boulogne.” Hist.

Act of Parliament for paving Gloucester, 1455; Fosbrooke’s
Gloucestershire, i. 157. For Exeter in 1466; Freeman’s Exeter,
91. For Canterbury in 1474, because the “evil report” carried
away by pilgrims “would be stopped if the roads were properly
pitched with boulders and Folkestone stone”; Hist. MSS. Com.
ix. 168, 144, 174. For Southampton in 1477, after a century of
vain attempts to pave the streets; Davies, 119, 120; in 1384
a tax was levied for pavage; in 1441 accounts were rendered
of paving stones provided; payments were made in 1457 to a
London paviour. By the Act each citizen was ordered to pave
before his own door as far as the middle of the street since
“the town was full feebly paved and full perilous and jeopardous
to ride or go therein, and in especial in the High Street,” so that
“strangers thither resorting have been oftentimes greatly hurt

To take a single instance, in 1421 the water-supply of
Southampton was undertaken by the council, and new leaden
pipes provided by the grant of a burgess who had thus bequeathed
his money “for the good of his soul.” An aqueduct was made
at considerable expense in 1428; 261 days’ work at it was paid
at from 4<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i> a day; over £12 more was spent on an iron
grating for it, and 27<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> given to the plumber who fixed it;
great stones from Wathe called “scaplyd stonys” were carried,
with loads of chalk, quicklime, pitch, rosin, solder, wax, and
wood. In 1490 a new well was made with a “watering-place
for horse and a washing-place for women.” Davies, 115, 117;
Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 138-40. In many towns wells were
repaired, enclosed with a wall and covered with a roof and put
under the care of wardens.</p>

The former devices for illegal taxation on the King’s part

was made after the accession of Richard the Second. Stubbs, ii.

Ibid. passus vi. 181. M. Jusserand (Epopée Mystique du Moyen

of common opinion Langland was. Compare the popular manifesto
of 1450. (Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 267.) “They say the King should
live upon his commons, and that their bodies and goods are his;
the contrary is true, for then needed him never to set Parliament

Reductions of rent are too numerous to give; they occurred
everywhere, and were sometimes apparently bought at a considerable
price. (See Round’s Geoffrey de Mandeville, 366.) Loans
from the towns seem to have been voluntary. In 1435 the
Sandwich commonalty refused to lend money to the King; and
further excused themselves from sending him soldiers for the
defence of Calais, “having all the men they can spare already
employed in the service of the Duke of York.” (Boys, 672.) A
grant to the King was again refused in 1486. (Ibid. 678.) The
Norwich citizens got into trouble for instituting a suit to have
their loan returned (Blomefield, iii. 147, 152). In 1424 Lynn
lent 400 marks, and in 1428 the council agreed that burgesses of
parliament should receive from executors of the late king a hundred
pounds for a pledged circlet of gold because they could not get more
(Hist. MSS. Com. xi. part 3, 161). In 1491 the king was at
Bristol, where he had a benevolence of £1,800 (Ricart, 47-48).
At the coming of Richard the Third in 1484, York, to gain a
reduction of the fee-ferm, agreed to give him 100 marks in a cup
of gold, and to the queen £100 in a dish. A list is given of the
citizens who subscribed&mdash;the mayor giving £20, the recorder £100,
and so on. The whole sum subscribed was £437 (Davis’ York,
167-9, 174). It would be quite impossible to mention all the
loans, but the instance of Canterbury is curious as the first foreshadowing
of the national debt. In 1438 £40 was lent to the
king, and in 1443 £50; in these cases private individuals
advanced the money in various amounts according to their taste
for speculation, and probably got certificates promising interest
and redemption at par (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. part 1, 139).</p>

“This low and material view of domestic life had led to an
equally low and material view of political life, and the cruelty
which stained the Wars of the Roses was but the outcome of a
state of society in which no man cared much for anything except
his own greatness and enjoyment. The ideal which shaped itself in
the minds of the men of the middle class was a king acting as a kind
of chief constable, who, by keeping great men in order, would allow
their inferiors to make money in peace.” (Gardiner’s Student’s
History, 330-1.) “The despondency of the English people, when
their dream of conquest in France was dissipated, was attended
with a complete decay of thought, with civil war, and with a
standing still or perhaps a decline of population, and to a less
degree of wealth.” (National Life and Character, by Charles
Pearson, p. 130-1.) “There are few more pitiful episodes in history.
Thirty-five years of a war that was as unjust as it was unfortunate
had both soured and demoralised the nation.” “England
had entirely ceased to count as a naval power.” As for the
burgesses, “if not actively mischievous they were sordidly inert.”

In Ricart’s Calendar in Bristol he enters duly the fact that a
battle had been fought and that one side or other was victorious
without further comment. He misplaces the date of the murder
of Suffolk three years, though he might well have remembered it;
and he writes as a sort of after-thought in the margin of his
record, “and this year the two sons of King Edward were put
to silence in the Tower of London.” (Ricart, 40-46.) In 1460
Norwich had its captain and 120 soldiers with King Henry in
the north, and all the rest of its available forces had to hurry
off to Edward at his accession. (Blomefield iii. 162-163.) The
city raised £160 for the coming of Richard the Third to the
city, and £140 for the coming of Henry the Seventh. (Ibid.
173-174.) For Nottingham, see vol. ii. There is no mention of
Bosworth in Canterbury, and Henry the Seventh was received
with the same pomp as former kings. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 145.)
For Bosworth, where men stood afar off waiting to join the victorious
side, see Fabyan, 672-673. The policy of the burghers was
the same in this respect as that of the great Churchmen, who
were entirely passive in the real crises of the civil war, and
so ready to serve every king, that not one of them suffered
loss from fidelity to any side. (Rogers’ Agricul. and Prices,
iv. 9, 10.) The people in general were equally indifferent.
“I have read thousands of documents penned during the heat of
the strife, and have found only one allusion to the character of
the times in the earlier, and one about the later war of 1470-1.”
(Ibid., 19.) An interesting parallel to the indifference of the
trading communities of the fifteenth century during the Wars of
the Roses may be seen in the action of the Merchants’ Company
in the civil wars of the seventeenth century. (Lambert’s Gild
Life, 177-178.)</p>

In Lydd corn was given to the poor at Christmas and
Easter, and gifts to lepers; payments made from 1480-1485 for
Goderynge’s daughter, “poor maid,” “hosen, shoes, her keep,
kertyl-cloth and for making thereof;” also in 1490, “paid
to the poor man keeping the poor child 12 pence.” After
a long list of expenses for a thief and making stocks for him and
a halter, “paid for one pair of shoes to his daughter 3<i>d.</i>,” and
“given to the quest of women 4<i>d.</i>”; summoned perhaps in
reference to the daughter. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 527, 526.) In
Rye sums were paid to the poor on opening the box of maltotes.
(Ibid. 494.) For Southampton, Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 112; the
steward’s book in 1441 contains a list of alms, £4 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, given
away every week to poor men and women. (Davies, 294.) According
to the usual calculation at this time in almshouses of a
penny a day for living, this sum would mean that the corporation
paid weekly for the mere subsistence of 140 persons. For
Bristol, Ricart’s Kalendar, 72-80, 82, &amp;c. For Chester, Hist.
MSS. Com. viii. 371. For Romney, Hist. MSS. Com. v. 535-6.
The Mayor of Sandwich had to manage the hospitals of S.
Bartholomew and S. John, to appoint their officers, to audit their
accounts, and administer their estates made up of innumerable
parcels of land and houses left by pious people. (Boys, 17-21,
526.) The municipal council of Exeter appointed every year
a Warden of the Poor to look after their many charitable foundations.
It had charge of Magdalen Hospital, of the Ten Cells
Hospital for Poor, founded in 1406 by Simon Grendon, Mayor;
the Combrew Almshouse, founded by Sir William Bonville, 1408;
and an almshouse founded by John Palmer. (Freeman’s Exeter,
175-6.) There was a municipal almshouse in Hereford supported
by way of payment to the corporation from ecclesiastical tenants
for a share in the city’s privileges. (Arch. Ass. Journ. xxvii.
481.) In the fifteenth century bequests by burgesses for these
purposes were very frequent and were usually left to the management
of the corporation. In all large towns the mayor and
aldermen presided over the court of orphans. (Davies’s Southampton,
239.) The indications of poor relief by the towns must
modify Mr. Ashley’s conclusion (Economic History, I. part ii.
338) that “no attempt was made by the State as a whole, <i>or by
any secular public authority</i>, to relieve distress. The work was
left <i>entirely</i> to the Church, and to the action of religious motives
upon the minds of individuals.” It seems difficult to follow in
this connexion his distinction drawn between the craft associations
which had or had not grown out of religious fraternities
(p. 325).</p>

Besides the customary Latin prayers a Norfolk guild used
English prayers for Church and State, harvest and travellers,
like our Litany. (English Guilds, 111-114.) The play of the
Lord’s Prayer was performed by a York guild. “They are
bound to find one candle-bearer, with seven lights, in token of
the seven supplications in the Lord’s Prayer.” “Also they are
bound to make, and as often as need be to renew, a table showing
the whole meaning and use of the Lord’s Prayer, and to keep
this hanging against a pillar in the said cathedral church near
to the aforesaid candle-bearer.” (Ibid. 137-9.) See also Hibbert’s
Shrewsbury Guilds, 62. For Pecok as “the first author of the
Middle Ages who propounded reason as a judge of faith,” and

of its theology”; and for the place now given to general
councils see Rogers’s Agriculture and Prices, iv. 11-13. For the

Mr. Jacobs tells me that he has found no direct evidence of
Jews lending to townspeople in the twelfth century; there are
only some indications such as that they sought for debtors in
S. Paul’s; (The Jews of Angevin England, p. 45) and that they
claimed to attend the assizes at Bury. (Ibid. 142.) If their
business lay, as it seems, with nobles and landowners, it would
prove the absence of any demand for capital in the towns.</p>

In 1442 the merchants of the Staple of Calais begged that
payment should be made to the soldiers for the surety of the
merchants’ wools. (Proceedings of Privy Council, v. 215, 216.)
When the lords seized Calais in 1459, “they shifted with the
Staple of Calais for £18,000” to carry on the war with. After
Edward’s accession, in 1462, the merchants claimed repayment.
Edward refused, and after long efforts the merchant who represented
them and had borne the chief charges died a ruined
man in sanctuary at Westminster (Fabyan, 635, 652-3).</p>

In 1472 the prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, buys from a
London alderman two pieces of cloth for gentleman’s livery, nine
for yeoman’s, and five for groom’s, the price, £39 14<i>s.</i>; from
a “raymaker” in New Salisbury he buys similar cloths in 1475
and 1480; again from Hadley, in 1499, he got eighteen pieces,
and russet cloths from a Cranbrooke clothier. (Hist. MSS. Com.
v. 436-7, 459.) Fastolfe bought cloth for his soldiers at Castlecoombe,
Wilts (Paston Letters). The Warden of Merton, Bishop
Fitz James, bought for his fellows and himself at Norton
Mandeville in Essex. (Rogers’ Economic Interpretation of

Brinklow’s Tracts, published in the first half of the sixteenth
century, afford interesting illustrations of the type of radical
politician formed in the towns. His proposal for a single chamber
and the list of reforms sketched out are not more significant
than his criticism of parliamentary despotism and inefficiency,
“This is the thirteenth article of our creed added of late, that
whatsoever the Parliament doth must needs be well done.
and the Parliament, or any proclamation out of the parliament
time cannot err ... then have ye brought Rome home
to your own doors and given the authority to the King and
Parliament that the cardinal bishops gave unto the Pope ... if
this be so, it is all vain to look for any amendment of anything.”

In 1447 exactions in England were so heavy “as that the
minds of men were not set upon foreign war, but vexed above
measure how to repel private and domestical injuries, and that
therefore neither pay for the soldier nor supply for the army
were as need required put in readiness.” (Polydore Vergil, 77
Camden Soc.) For interruption of trade by the war, Paston, i.
425-6. Davies’ Southampton, 252-3. The Staplers complain
that before the war the French bought yearly 2,000 sacks of
wool, now only 400 (Schanz, ii. 568). For effect of the war on

The fellowship of the mercers and other merchants and
adventurers living in London “by confederacy made among
themselves of their uncharitable and inordinate covetous for their
singular profit and lucre contrary to every Englishman’s liberty,
and to the liberty of the Mart there” made an ordinance and
constitution that every Englishman trading with the marts of
Flanders or under the Archduke of Burgundy should first pay a
fine to the Merchants’ Fellowship in London on pain of forfeiture
of all their wares bought and sold. The fine was at first half an
old noble, and demanded by a colour of a fraternity of S. Thomas
at Canterbury, and “so by colour of such feigned holiness it hath
been suffered to be taken for a few years past.” Finally,
however, the London Fellowship raised the fine to £20, then the
other merchants began to withdraw from the marts and the cloth
trade to suffer. On the complaint of the merchant adventurers
living outside London Parliament ordered that the fine should
only be ten marks. (12 Henry VII., cap. 6.) For the complaint
of the Hull traders against the merchant adventurers of London

Southampton had to keep a ship, “le Grâce de Dieu,” at its
own expense for the king’s service. In the last year of Henry
the Sixth its master received from the mayor £31 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> In
the first year of Edward the Fourth the mayor paid for the
victualling and custody of the ship £68 5<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> In 1470 there
was a great deal of difficulty about the matter. The king ordered
certain payments to be made for the ship which the town for
some months absolutely refused to carry out. The sheriff at last
stepped into the breach and paid the sums due from money in his
own office, and the next year the town was forced by the king to
refund what he had spent. Three successive sheriffs were in
difficulties about this dispute between the king and the town.
They made payments as best they could, and were afterwards
given indemnity for the sums they spent. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi.

Schanz, i. 356-7, 362, 367. On page 357 he quotes from a
petition of the commons in 1371 (Rot. Parl. ii. 306-7) to prove
that the one result of the foreign policy of Edward the First was
the <i>narrowing of town franchises</i>, and consequent decline of the
navy. If the petition is read to the close the passage seems to
be merely a piece of fine writing to arrest attention, and the town
franchises are not mentioned again when the king asks to have
the real grievances stated. In the second petition (Rot. Parl. ii.
332) the gist of the complaint is that foreign merchants are
allowed to sell and buy in England, which is represented as a
loss of all their franchises.</p>

Hist. MSS. Com. v. 496. Rye kept its own “schipwrite,”
John Wikham, who had the freedom of the town for sixteen
years while building the ships of the port, and at last left in
1392 with a glowing testimonial from the mayor and barons of
Rye. Along with other towns it had made profit by selling ships
to aliens, which might afterwards be used by the enemies of
England, and a proclamation was sent to Rye in 1390 forbidding
such sales. For the export of eggs from Norwich in 1374, as well
as butter and cheese and corn, and possibly oysters, see Hudson’s

the King sent the Bishop of Winchester to say he need not fear,

In 1505. Henry VII. issued regulations for the Merchant
Adventurers. They might meet <i>in Calais</i> to elect governors;
and they were at the same time to elect a council of twenty-four
called “assistants,” who were to have jurisdiction over
all members and power to make statutes, and to appoint
officers both in England and in Calais to levy fines and to
imprison offenders. The council filled up its own vacancies.
Every merchant using the dealings of a Merchant Adventurer
was not only to pay its tolls and taxes, but must enter the fellowship
and pay his ten marks. The Calais officials were to proclaim
the marts whenever required to do so. The Adventurers might
appoint their own weighers and packers, and have nothing to say
to the royal officers. (Schanz, ii. 549-553.)</p>

In November, 1504, the Staplers and Adventurers appeared
before the Star Chamber. The Staplers pleaded a charter which
declared them free from the jurisdiction of the Adventurers. The
Star Chamber decided that every Stapler who dealt or traded as
an Adventurer was to be subject to the courts and dues of the
Adventurers: and every Adventurer dealing as a Stapler in like
manner to be subject to the Staple (Schanz, ii. 547). This
decision seemed to imply the ruin of Staplers, but the next year
it was explained that the authentic interpretation was simply
that “the merchants of the Staple at Calais using the feate of a
Merchant Adventurer passing to the marts at Calais should <i>in
those things</i> be contributories to such impositions and charges” as
the Adventurers had fixed (ibid. 549); and that they could not be
compelled to join the Adventurers’ company. In 1510 Henry
the Eighth repeated the decree of Henry the Seventh that the
Adventurers must not force Staplers to join their body (555).
For the pleadings before the Star Chamber under Henry the
Eighth see Schanz, ii. 556-564.</p>

Pauli’s Pictures, 172, 185. Keutgen, 10-43. Richard the
Second complained to the Grand Master that traders were forced
to carry their cloth to Elbing instead of Danzig (ibid. 72). In
1388 three citizens of London and York were sent to Marienberg
with an interpreter to make a treaty of commerce with the
“general master of the house of S. Mary of Teutonia.” (Hist.
MSS. Com. i. 109.) In 1397, however, trade with the Easterlings
was practically stopped. The English imposed enormous duties on
German imports; the Germans forbade traffic in English cloth.
For the negotiations carried on by Henry the Fourth see Literæ
Cantuarienses, iii. xxviii.-xxxi., and the various letters on the
subject. The English colony in Danzig increased greatly after
the peace of Marienberg. (Schanz, i. 231.) In 1392 more than
300 English came into Danzig to carry corn. (Keutgen, 71.)
But the resistance of the Danzig burghers to English trade
was strenuous. They were less jealous of the Netherlands
manufacturers, and the Teutonic Order in the fifteenth century
sent to Dinant for the rough cloth needed for the Baltic trade.

In 1425 there were letters from Henry the Sixth to the King
of Dacia, Norwegia, and Swecia, concerning the merchants of
Lynn who traded with the parts of North Berne; (Hist. MSS.
Com. xi. 3, 203). In 1427 he wrote to the English merchants “in
partibus Prucie, Dacie, Norweie, Hanse, and Swethie commorantes,”
to assemble in a sufficient place, elect governors and
make ordinances for self-government in mercantile matters, and
for reasonable punishment of any merchants disobedient (203).
At times the English even forced compensation from the Hanse
merchants for outrages (Schanz, i. 250). In 1438 rye was brought
from Prussia “by the providence of Stephen Browne,” the mayor,
at a time of famine in England, when a bushel of corn was sold
for 3s. 4d., and the people were making bread of vetches, peas,
beans, and fern-roots. (Fabyan, 612.)</p>

The fortunes of Memling’s Last Judgement now at Danzig
give a curious illustration of this war and the trade complications
of the time. Ordered at Bruges through the Florentine agents
there (the Portinari), probably by Julian and Lorenzo de Medici,
the picture could not be carried to Florence on account of this war
begun in 1468. At last in 1473 it was sent off from Sluys in a
British-built ship, which had been bought by English merchants
as a French prize, chartered by Florentines in Bruges for a voyage
to London, registered in the name of the Portinari, commissioned
by a French captain, and navigated under the Burgundian flag
for greater security against capture. It was, however, taken off
Southampton by a privateer sailing under the Danzig flag and
commanded by a noted captain Benecke. In spite of a bull
issued by Sixtus the Fourth the cargo was sold at Stade and the
picture brought by the owners of the ship to Danzig. (Crowe and
Cavalcaselle, Early Flemish Painters, 257-260.)</p>

For the negotiations between the Easterlings and the English
merchants, see Schanz, ii. 397-430; i. 179-201. In 1498 Archduke
Philip, seeing the utter ruin into which Bruges had fallen,
tried to revive it by ordering that all foreign merchants should
do their business there only, by improving the harbour, <i>and by
making it the Staple for English cloths in Flanders</i>. (Schanz, i.
26-27.) In 1501 Philip made Bruges a Staple where English cloth
might be sold in Flanders under strict conditions. (Ibid. ii. 203-6.)
In 1506 Henry won from the Archduke the right to sell cloth
by the yard and to have the manufacture of it finished in all his
dominions except Flanders. (Ibid. i. 31.)</p>

The friendly way in which the English merchants even in
1405 looked on Genoese traders is illustrated in the story told
by Fabyan (571), of three carracks of Genoa laden with merchandise
plundered by English lords. The Genoese merchants
made suit to the King for compensation, and meanwhile borrowed
from English merchants goods amounting unto great and noble
sums. When their suit was seen to be in vain they made off
with their spoils “to the undoing” of many merchants.</p>

The authorities of York decreed that the soldiers sent on a
Scotch campaign should be given their wages for the first fourteen
days, and the captain should have in his pocket the money for
the second fortnight. The troops struck, however, and insisted
on having the whole twenty-eight days’ pay before they started,
and the town had at last to give in as the only way of getting
the expedition started. (Davies’ York 132-7.) The soldiers,
once paid, often did no more than start on their journey and then
“sraggle about by themselves” with their pay in their pockets.

In Canterbury, any man drawing a knife was fined or imprisoned
forty days. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 172.) In Sandwich if
any one wounded another with a sword or knife he might choose
one of three punishments, a fine of 60s. to the commonalty, imprisonment
for a year and a day, or to have his hand perforated
with the weapon by which he had inflicted the wound. (Boys 502.)</p>

Parker, Manor of Aylesbury, 20-21. “Also I complain,”
said one of them pitifully, “upon James Fleccher for fraying of my
wife about 10 o’clock in the night and I ready for to go to bed,
standing scolding at my door bidding me come out of thy doors
an thou dare with his dagger in his hand ready to break the
king’s peace.” The prudent constable, however, refrained from
coming out and was content to appeal to the next court; “he is
coming and therefore I beseech you of peace of his godabery.”
In Canterbury one of the watchmen called to a person “walking
out of due time” to know wherefore he walked there so late.
“The suspect person gave none answer, but ran from thence
into St. Austin’s liberty and before the door of one John Short
they took him. And the same John Short came out of his house
with other misknown persons and took from the said watchmen
their weapons and there menaced them for to beat contrary to the
oath of a true and faithful freeman.” (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 174.)</p>

“The freemen of the borough of Huntingdon have this week
been engaged in the observance of a curious and ancient local
custom. With their sons, the whole of the freemen of the borough
have assembled in the morning in the Market-place. The skull
of an ox borne on two poles was placed at the head of a procession,
and then came the freemen and their sons, a certain number of
them bearing spades and others sticks. Three cheers having been
given, the procession moved out of the town and proceeded to
the nearest point of the borough boundary, where the skull was
lowered. The procession then moved along the boundary line of
the borough, the skull being dragged along the line as if it were
a plough. The boundary holes were dug afresh, and a boy thrown
into each hole and struck with a spade. At a particular point,
called Blacktone Leys, refreshments were provided, and the boys
competed for prizes. The skull was then again raised aloft, and
the procession returned to the Market-place, where three more
hurrahs were given before it broke up.” (From the Pall Mall
Gazette, September 16th, 1892.) In Hythe Holy Thursday was the
day of perambulation. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv. i. 432.) For Canterbury

For common pasture and closes see short account in Rogers’
Six Centuries of Work and Wages, i. 89-90, taken from Fitzherbert’s
Treatise. In 1484 a great riot broke out in York on the
question of the common lands. The King had begged the council
to make an order that a close which belonged to S. Nicholas, but
was common from Michaelmas to Candlemas, should be “closed
and several” for the use of the hospital if the commons would
agree to the same. The order was made, but a few days after
Michaelmas, when the close was not thrown open as was customary,
the citizens met in a “riotous assembly or insurrection”
which led to interference of the King. (Davies’ York, 190-198.)
In Winchester (1414) John Parmiter was punished for accusing
the mayor of intending to sell the Coitebury mill without consent
of the citizens. (Kitchen’s Winchester, 171.) For other instances

At Worcester the common coffer which contained the city
deeds and moneys was fastened with six locks; three keys were
kept by the bailiff, an alderman, and a chamberlain, chosen by
the “Great Clothing,” or the council of “the twenty-four above;”
the other three by a chamberlain chosen by the “Low Election”
or the council of “the Forty-eight beneath,” and by two “thrifty
commoners.” Eng. Gilds, 377.</p>

In Romney the town paid every year to have seats put in the
church of S. Lawrence on the day of the Annunciation. (Hist.
MSS. Com. v. 546.) In the same way town accounts at Rye were
made up and audited in the church at the end of the year. (Ibid. v.
494.) Lydd in 1471 “spended in the church upon the bailly and
jurats when they enquired what lyvelod men have in Lydd two
pence.” (Ibid. 525.)</p>

Hist. MSS. Com. iv. 1, 438. The Hythe barge brought back
three lasts of herrings which were sold for £12. In 1409 Romney
Jurats got 6s. increase upon white salt bought for the community.
(Ibid. v. 537.) If a corporation was in need of money it could
always fall back on loans from rich townsmen, who were willing
to lend even on long credit. In 1455 or 1456 one Canterbury
merchant lent £13 6s. 8d., which was needed for a gift to the
queen, then travelling on pilgrimage, and he was only repaid in
1464. Three leading men, who advanced large sums to do honour
to Edward the Fourth on his first coming to the city in 1460,
waited four or five years for their money. (Ibid. ix. 139-140.) In
Lynn the loans to the corporation were on a very great scale
according to the ideas of the time, and the municipal debt, entirely
raised on the spot, was as permanent and as progressive as that
of a modern town.</p>

One man received £30 10s. in various sums, 3s. 4d. a rod for
nineteen rods, 1s. 8d. a rod for 106 rods, and 12d. a rod for 380
rods. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv. 1, 434.) For forty years the men of
Romney fought a desperate battle with the sea and the changing
bed of the Rother to preserve the harbour on which their prosperity
depended. In 1381 they spent nearly £9 on making a
sluice (Boys’ Sandwich, 803); there were heavy payments for it
again in 1388, and in 1398 John Roan was brought over from
Flanders to take charge of it. The commons turned out in 1406
for “digging the common Rie,” or bed of the Rother, and in
1409 were again busy “digging the water-course.” In 1410
Gerard Matthyessone was brought over from Holland to make
the sluice at a cost of £100; in 1412 over £44 was spent on it
besides clothing for Gerard and his household; and in 1413 payments
were still being made to him. A few years later in 1422
his place was taken by another Dutchman, Onterdel, who seems
to have finished the work, for after this there are only charges
for slight repairs. Their improvements remained the model for
neighbouring towns, and when Lydd was occupied in works of
the same kind its citizens came to study the jetty at Romney.</p>

decreed in 1431 “that the three players shall serve the community
this year for 21s., and their clothing to be had of every
house;” but two years later the players demanded an increase of
their “reward,” and a grant was made to each of them of 20s.
and their clothing, in return for which “they shall go through
the town with their instruments from the Feast of All Saints to
the following Feast of the Purification.” (Hist. MSS. Com.

The belfry where the clock hung played so important a part
in the communes of France that the right to have a belfry and a
town hall were given by charter when the commune was established,
and were taken away when it was suppressed (Ordonnances
des Rois de France, vol. xi., cxlii., cxliii.), and the bell-tower
often formed the town prison. In England, on the other hand,
the town clock and the assembly and curfew bells in almost all
cases were set in the tower of the parish church, and the ringers
paid by the corporation.</p>

Piers Ploughman, passus vii. 144. In Totnes in the thirteenth
century there is a long list of entries such as these:&mdash;
“Alice wife of Walter Cochela sits above the seats of Walter
rustic;” “Nicholas son of Henry has his seat by common
purchase;” and so on. And down to recent times the mayor,
who by tradition represents the head of the Merchant Guild, was
charged with appointing seats in the church to the inhabitants.
(Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 242-3.) In Liverpool, “according to
ancient custom,” the city officers and their wives had special seats in
S. Nicholas, and after them the householders; “apprentices and
servants shall sit or stand in the alleys.” (Picton’s Liverpool,

Cinque Ports met at the church of S. James. (Ibid. v. 528, 538.)
For Rye, Ibid., 499. The meetings of the town council in Southampton
were probably first held in the church of S. Cross or
Holy Rood, where the assembly bell and curfew bell hung; and
so closely did the idea of the town life come to be connected with
this spot that when a town hall was built in the fourteenth
century the church was moved further back that the hall might
stand on its exact site. As late as 1470 the mayor and his

Hythe, Hist. MSS. Com. iv. 1, 432. Bridport, Hist. MSS.
Com. vi. 495; Andover, Gross, ii. 345. In Lynn all houses leased
for 20s. a year were bound to supply the blessed bread and
wax for S. Margaret’s, and the most elaborate rules were drawn
up to regulate the contributions which were to be paid by tenements
lying together, or by various tenements under one roof.
In case payment was refused the common sergeant, or any officer
sent by the mayor, might levy a distress and carry off the
tenant’s goods to the Guild Hall to be kept till he had made
satisfaction or paid a fine of 20s. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 161.)
Payments for the holy fire are frequent. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv.

In 1327 a violent quarrel broke out between Sandwich and
Canterbury. The convent was put to great inconvenience, and
the prior wrote to “the mayor and bailiff of Sandwich” asking
to be allowed to buy food and wax, as they had been put
to great straits. The Sandwich men agreed on condition that the
monks should in no manner relieve or give supplies to the Canterbury
citizens. (Lit. Cantuar. i. 248-254.) There was great
jealousy between Norwich and Yarmouth. Yarmouth was made
a Staple town in 1369, in spite of all the efforts of Norwich. In
1390 Norwich paid large sums to have the wool staple at Norwich
again. (Blomefield, iii. 96, 113.) In the fifteenth century
Yarmouth set up a crane, which the Norwich men forced it to take
down again.</p>

The towns were not wholly untouched by the struggle but
their interest was very languid. Many, like London, were divided
in sympathy. (Polydore Vergil, 106; English Chronicle, 1377-1461,
20-1, 67, 95; Fabyan, 638.) During this queasy season
the Mayor of London feigned him sick and kept his house a
great season. (Ibid. 660; see also Warkworth’s Chronicle,
12-22.) Bristol and Colchester were Yorkist (Hunt’s Bristol,
97-100, 102; Cutts’ Colchester, 131-2). For Nottingham see vol.
ii. The chief interest was probably felt in Kent and Sussex.
(English Chronicle, 1377-1461, 84, 91-4.) Canterbury was
against Cade and Lancastrian in sympathy (ibid. 84-95; Hist.
MSS. Com. ix. 140-3, 168, 170, 176-7); but in 1464 entered in
its accounts presents to the brothers of the king “nunc.”
The city suffered severely. The Cinque Ports went generally for
Warwick and York. Lydd sent Cade a porpoise to London, and
a letter to have his friendship in case he succeeded. (Hist. MSS.
Com. v. 518, 520, 523, 525.) For Romney, ibid. 543, 545; Rye,

The agricultural tenants and labourers on a manor were
accustomed to elect from among themselves a “Provost” to be
head over them and to stand between them and their lord, whom
they were pledged to obey in all things, and who on his side
undertook to answer for them to their master. Bound by the
closest ties of mutual responsibility, their fortunes were inseparably
connected. If the lord suffered any loss, small or great, by
the tenant’s fault, the provost had to pay the value, recovering it
afterwards as best he could from the servant who was to blame;
and on the other hand if the damage had come through the
provost’s neglect, and he had not of his own property the wherewithal
to make it good, all those of the township who elected
him had to pay for him; and hence people and lord alike in self-protection
upheld the rule that the provost must be no stranger
of doubtful character or property, but chosen “from their own
men,” and that “by election of the tenants.” (Walter of
Henley, edited by E. Lamond, Husbandry, 65.) It is easy to see
the similarity between the simple methods of rural government
and the organization of municipal independence under an elected
mayor. An admirable illustration is given in Mr. Maitland’s
Manorial Pleas, Selden Society, 161-175.</p>

At Bury S. Edmunds there were seventy-five tradesmen of
various kinds, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, &amp;c., who were bound
to cut corn in harvest, the services being commuted for a rent
called reap silver when the place became a borough. At Battle,
under Henry the Second, 115 burgage tenements were occupied
by tradesmen who had to work in the meadows or at the mill,
but were called burgesses “on account of the superior dignity of
the place’s excellence.” Rep. on Markets, 17, note.</p>

From examination of the names of the Norwich inhabitants
in the Conveyance Rolls, Mr. Hudson thinks it certainly within

sixty Suffolk, towns, villages, and manors.” Notes on Norwich,

The old feeling about burgage property is shown in the
custom of Nottingham that when a man sold land his nearest
heirs might redeem it if they made an offer in the Guild
Hall within a year and a day of the sale to pay to the buyer
the price he had given; and they might thus redeem even if the
buyer refused to accept their offer. Cases of a messuage and a
butcher’s booth thus redeemed (Nott. Rec. i. 70, 100). See
also at Dover (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 274). In Lincoln and
Torksey no burgess could sell his burgage tenement save to a
burgess or a kinsman without leave (Rep. on Markets, 35).
The mayor and jurats of Rye might compel a tenant to keep his
house in proper order, “at the request of him that is in the
reversion.” (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 362.)</p>

Council that no Irishman born might be admitted to the Council
by the Mayor under penalty of £20 each from the Mayor
and from the Irishman. In Canterbury also the Irish were
busy and unpopular traders (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 173). When
Irishmen were ordered out of England in 1422, burgesses and
inhabitants of boroughs of good reputation were excepted.

A bondman born could in many if not in most towns win the
freedom of the city, as in Norwich where serfs were admitted to
the franchise; but it is clear that here certainly mere residence
without admission to citizenship was no protection against the
claims of a feudal lord. (Norf. Arch. vol. xii.; Hudson’s
Notes on Norwich, Sec. xi.) It is most probable that the common
phrases of “dwelling in the town a year and a day, and
holding land in it and being in lot and scot,” or of being “in the
Merchant Guild,” or of “remaining in the town <i>without challenge</i>,”
were in fact equivalent to having been received as burghers;
and in such cases emancipation was won not by a year’s residence
but by a year’s citizenship. In Norwich a serf had to produce his
lord’s license. (Hudson’s Leet Jur. in Norwich, Selden Soc.
lxxxv.-vi.) For a similar instance of feudal claims urged by a lord
over his serf dwelling in a city, see Owen’s Shrewsbury, i. 133.
Compare the references given by Gross, i. 30. There were
exceptions, as in London, where men who held land in villeinage
of the Bishop of London were not allowed in 1305 to be
freemen of the City (Riley’s Mem. 58-9). And after the
Peasant Revolt some towns withdrew the privilege (Hist. MSS.
Com. i. 109).</p>

A chaplain and four parsons of churches in Norwich were
presented before the Leet Court of Norwich for various offences in
1292, in 1374, and in 1390. One of them had occupied himself
with a large brewing business, another traded as a wool merchant,
and two were charged with not being citizens. There were in
all towns plenty of “clerici” who were citizens. (Hudson’s
Norwich Leet Jurisdiction, Selden Soc. pp. 45, 63, 65, 76.) For
burgages owned by parsons and clerics in Southampton, Hist.
MSS. Com. xi. 3, 65, 70, 71, 75, 81. In Romney, where “the
freedom” seems to have meant more than the right to trade, it
was given to the vicar and others. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 540, 542,
546-7.) Monks and heads of religious houses were, according to
Dr. Gross, excluded from citizenship (i. 66) though given rights
of trade; but from the Charter Rolls, John, 1215, it appears
that in Bridgewater the brethren of the Hospital of S. John were
to be capable of taking up burgages in the town and to have the
same liberties within and without the town as burgesses. This
instance, has been kindly given to me by Miss Greenwood from
her study of the muniments of the town; she adds that in the
documents at Bridgewater there are many instances of houses
and market-stalls being held by clergy. In all the bills of sale
<i>stalls in High Street</i> are named burgages, and a lawsuit shows
that a wool-stall there was sold to the abbot of Michelney. For
Ipswich, Gross, ii. 123; and Andover, ibid. 321. Local customs
doubtless differed. The Guild Merchant at Lynn allowed no
“spiritual person” to work on their quay&mdash;that is, to trade there
(ibid. ii. 166)&mdash;a circumstance which reflects the greater credit
on the hermit who about 1349 lived in the Bishop’s marsh by
Lynn and set up at his own great cost a certain remarkable
cross of the height of 110 feet, of great service for all shipping
coming that way (Blomefield viii. 514). When the burgesses of
Totnes admitted the abbot and convent of Buckfastleigh into
the Merchants’ Guild, so as to make all their purchases like the
burgesses, all sales that they might attempt to make “by way
of trading” were excepted. Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 343.</p>

For the various ways of winning municipal freedom see First
Rep. of the Commissioners on Mun. Corporations, 1835, 19, and
especially the table given on page 93. Even towns as closely
connected as the Cinque Ports differed much in their willingness
to admit new burgesses. The freedom of Sandwich might be
acquired in six ways&mdash;by birth, by marriage with a free woman,
by buying a free tenement, by seven years’ apprenticeship, by
purchase, by gift of the Corporation. In New Romney freedom
could only be acquired by birthright in the male line, and grant
of the Corporation; while in Hythe all children born after the
father’s admission to freedom were entitled to the freedom, and
daughters could convey it upon their marriage (Boys’ Sandwich,
787, 796, 799, 812, 821). The same differences existed in other
towns. See Davies’ Southampton, 140; Boase’s Oxford, 48;
English Guilds, 390; Freeman’s Exeter, 142; Hereford, Journ.
Arch. Ass. xxvii. 471, 468.</p>

to ask (Freeman’s Exeter, 142). In Canterbury freemen were
admitted in the fourteenth century for 10<i>s.</i>; in 1480 the sum
had risen to 40<i>s.</i> (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 144). See also Hereford
(Journal Arch. Ass., xxvii.). In the sixteenth century
the jury of the Mickle Tourn of Nottingham presented a request
that every foreigner should henceforth pay £10. (Nott. Rec.

In Hereford the freeman who lost his position for perjury
could never recover it save by the special favour of the commonalty,
“and by the redemption of his goods and chattels at
least for twice as much as he gave before.” Any citizen who had
been sentenced to the pillory, tumbrill or the like, “by that
means let him lose his freedom; but afterwards by the special
favour of his bailiff and the commonalty he may be redeemed.”

Public disapproval was held to be a powerful motive. In Hereford
if a plaintiff brought a writ of right for the possession of a
tenement into the court and the defendant refused to appear at
the court, “there ought to be taken from the tenement demanded
one post and to be brought unto the court and delivered to the
bailiff; and the second time two; and the third time three; and
<i>this to be done always towards the street, in reproach to him, and to
the noting of his fellow-citizens</i>; and if he shall not come, the
house ought to be thrown down, by taking one post towards the
street, and so forward and forward until the whole house be
thrown down to the ground.” (Journal Arch. Ass., xxvii. 481-2.)</p>

“The Mayor of the city of York and his brethren made great
instance” to Lord Surrey to see that their fellow citizen, Thomas
Hartford, bower in Norwich, should not be annoyed by Thomas
Hogan, a shoemaker. (Paston Letters, iii. 366.) This protection
however was only given on the condition of his renouncing
all other aid. The mayor of York and his brethren aldermen
in 1488 were applied to by Sir Robert Plumpton to protect some
“servants and lovers” of his dwelling in York from annoyance
by certain York citizens. The mayor answered in the name of
himself, the aldermen, and the common council, that these dependants
of Plumpton’s had been franchised and sworn to keep the
customs of the city of York, that they were therefore bound to
show any variance or trouble to the mayor “and to none other,
and he to see an end betwixt them.” The mayor plainly
intimates that these men must either go home and live under the
protection of their master there, or else if they stay in York
must submit their affairs to the mayor alone “as their duties had
been.” (Plumpton Correspondence, 57-58.)</p>

Especially in matters of debt and arrest. Stubbs’ Charters,

English Guilds, 391; Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 170-1. Henry the
Second granted to burgesses of Wallingford that if his provost
impleaded any one of them without an accuser, he need not
answer the charge. (Gross, ii. 244.) See Newcastle, Stubbs’
Charters, 107. The importance of these provisions is obvious if
the custom of Sandwich was common. There the mayor might
arrest and imprison any one whom he chose as a “suspect.”
After some time the prisoner was brought from the castle to the
Mastez and a “cry” made to ask if there were any one to prosecute
him. If no one appeared he was set free on giving
security, but if he could find no security he might at the mayor’s
will be banished for ever from the town. The bailiff could not
arrest on suspicion as the mayor did. (Boys’ Sandwich, 687,

fixed at twelve, sometimes at fourteen. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix.

he held outside the town liberties, which must pass to the
heir appointed by the common law. For the frauds to which
this might give rise, see Hist. MSS. Com. x. 3, 87-9. Wills
bequeathing land were read publicly in the borough courts
(Nottingham Records, i. 96), and there enrolled by the
mayor as a Court of Record. The muniments of Canterbury show
that from this right the mayor went on to claim probate,
possibly following the example of Lynn. The claim was perfectly
illegal, but was energetically pressed.</p>

Birmingham, which under Henry the Eighth had 2,000
houselings, and was said to be “one of the fairest and most profitable
towns to the King’s highness in all the shire” (English
Guilds, 247-9), only counted in Doomsday nine heads of
families. In 1327 these had risen to seventy-five. The burghers
first won the lightening of feudal dues, when Birmingham was
freed from ward and marriage, heriot and relief, so that if a
burgess died the lord could only take his best weapon&mdash;a bill or
a pole-axe&mdash;or forty pence. (Survey of the Borough and Manor
of Birmingham, 1553. Translated by W. B. Bickley, with notes by
Joseph Hill, pp. xii., 108.) The bailiff and commonalty rented the
stalls in the market from the lord, and leased them out by their
constables to the townsfolk, fishmongers, butchers, and tanners,
and in this way secured complete control of the town market (pp.
60-61), where burgesses were exempt from toll, while strangers
free of the market paid a small sum, and those not free a larger
amount. After the Plague a “free burgage by fealty” grew up,
with an oath to observe the customs and services of the manor.
The normal holding of the villein seems to have been forty-five
acres, that of the cotters less (pp. xii., xiii. See Rogers’ Agric.
and Prices, i. 12, 298). As population increased new pastures in
the foreign were leased out for a term of years at an annual rent,
and while the increase of perpetual free tenures thus ceased the
alienation of the whole domain was prevented (pp. xiv., 74, 102).
Though the town was not made a borough by royal grant, it had
even in the thirteenth century secured an independent life, called
itself a borough and elected its officers (pp. 60-1, 108-9). Its
public acts were done under the style of “bailiff and commonalty”
or “bailiff and burgesses.” See also Manchester Court Leet
Records, 12, 14, 169, 170. For examples of the first privileges
which the townspeople sought to win see the “customs” of

For the profits to be made in this business and its opportunities
of fraud, see Winchelsea (Rot. Parl. i. 373). Sometimes
the escheator divided the fines levied between himself and
the King; in other cases the office was farmed out and the King
took a fixed sum leaving the escheator a free hand to do what he
pleased. In the towns the office was finally given to the mayor
at a fixed salary. The Mayor of Norwich received as escheator
£10; that is, an equal salary to that which he received as
Mayor (Blomefield, iii. 179). As Mayor of the Staple he was
given £20. (Ibid. iii. 94.)</p>

In Rochester “the King’s hackney-men” took oath to be

able hackney horses at the calling of the Mayor, and to provide

give information to the Mayor in case any hard-driven hackney-man
in the town “purloin or hide any of their able hackney horses

Instances of the necessity for new grants and confirmations
and the heavy consequent expenses are too numerous to quote.
In Canterbury £36 was paid in 1460 for a new charter, and
other payments connected with the same business were made in
the following year. In 1472 messengers were sent to London
for the obtaining again of a charter of liberties. Two years
later an envoy rode to London to treat with the Treasurer, Lord
Essex, about a writ of proviso touching the liberties of the city,
and a grant was then made, probably in return for heavy payment,
which confirmed a recent restoration of ancient privileges.
A magnificent supper given to Lord Essex expressed the gratitude
of the city. In 1474 the city paid for a proviso to confirm the
restorations of their liberties. In 1475 there was an investigation
<i>in camera</i> of the charters and muniments concerning the
bounds of the liberty; and in 1481 payments were made to friends
and patrons who had helped them with the King in preserving the
liberties of the city. At the accession of Henry the Seventh it
became necessary to buy renewal and confirmation of the charter,
and this was completed in 1487. In 1490 the Mayor conferred
with Cardinal Morton on the renewal and extension of the
liberties of the city. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 140 <i>et seq.</i>, 170.) See

The election of a Mayor as a responsible person through

As against the idea of Merewether and Stephens, that
charters of municipal incorporation only began in 1439, Dr.
Gross points out that such a charter occurs in 1345, that in the

conception came into being the borough had a real corporate
existence, and exercised all the functions of a corporate body.

We have a hint of a troublesome mode of interference with
the municipal taxation in an incident in Norwich in 1268, when
“the lord the King commanded all his bailiffs that, <i>for a fine</i>
£10, <i>which Margaret the Taneresse of Norwich made with the
same lord the King</i>, he granted to her such liberty that for the
whole time of her life she should be quit from all his tallages
in the town of Norwich ... for whatsoever cause they may
be made. And he commanded that they vex not the aforesaid
Margaret contrary to this his grant.” (Norwich Documents,
pr. 1884, 9.) In any case where the tallage was a fixed sum
due from the town some one else would have to pay Margaret’s
share.</p>

Journ. Arch. Ass. xxvii. 482. For a duel in Leicester in
1201, see Select Civil Pleas, Selden Society, p. 33. Judicial
combat in Fordwich with an alien had to take place in the middle
of the river Stour, the alien standing up to his middle in the
water, while the Fordwich man apparently fought from a boat
tied to the quay, with an instrument called an “ore,” three yards
long. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 442.) In 1200 “the citizens of
Lincoln came and produced the king’s charter which witnesses that
none of them need plead outside the city walls except the king’s
moneyers and servants, and that they need not fight the duel
because of any appeal.” An accused man answered the charges
against him “word by word as a free citizen of Lincoln,” and
“according to the franchise of the town” waged law with thirty-six
compurgators. (Select Pleas of the Crown, Selden Society,
p. 39.) For compurgation in Sandwich in 1493, Boys, 680.</p>
<p class="pfc4">With old forms of trial old forms of punishment were allowed
to survive. In Sandwich, if a man failed to clear himself by
compurgation of a charge of homicide or theft he was condemned
to be buried alive in a place called the Thiefdown at Sandown.
(Ibid. 465.) Felons were also drowned in a stream called “the
Gestling”; but in 1313 a complaint was made that the prior of
Christchurch had diverted the course of the stream, and that
criminals could not be executed in that way for want of water. (Ibid.
664.) At Dover and Folkestone a thief was killed by being thrown
from a cliff, and at Winchelsea was hanged in the salt marsh.
(Lyon’s Dover, i. 231.) In others of the Cinque Port towns
when a thief was taken his ear was nailed to a post or cartwheel
and a knife put in his hand, he had to free himself by
cutting off his ear, to pay a fine, and to forswear the town. In
1470, 12<i>d.</i> was paid “for nailing of Thomas Norys his ear.”

It has been argued (Gneist, Constit. Communale, tr. Hippert,
i. 263; v. 275) that the State created local government in the towns
as a method of developing better administration, and that it was
therefore only accidentally and as a secondary consequence that independence
and local liberties came in the wake of this administrative
system. The facts, however, of their story make it perfectly
clear that municipal liberties were of natural growth, and sprang
out of local needs rather than out of Court statecraft.</p>

Europe. They generally represented a fortress or walled town,
a ship, a patron saint, or heraldic arms, but it is interesting that

save in the London seal, where he stands among the corporation

There was constant watchfulness on both sides as to their
rights. In 1400 the bailiffs of Ipswich granted land for the
building of a mill for the benefit of the corporation; the King’s
officers declared the grant to have been made without the royal
licence, and the mill was seized for the King. On the other
hand, when the sheriff of the county arrested a felon in the
liberties of Ipswich and put him in the King’s jail, the bailiffs

That is on the plea of lack of justice in the borough court.
In 1401, when the citizens of Canterbury were summoned by the
Crown to appear at Westminster about a breach of the statutes
for the regulation of the victualling trades, they pleaded that by
their charter they could not be called to answer civil suits out of
their own city. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 167.)</p>

In 1299 the amercements ordered by the Leet Court of Norwich
amounted to £72 18s. 10d.; the amount accounted for by the
collectors was £17 0s. 2d. (Hudson’s Leet Jurisd. of Norwich,
Selden Soc. xl.) Where there was profit to be made the King
was, however, always on the alert. In Piers Ploughman,
Passus v., 169, he complains bitterly of the lawyers; “through
your law I believe I lose my escheats!”; and it was often late
before he made the mayor escheator. In 1492 two Scotch priests
were arrested in Ipswich for treasonable talk, and the King granted
their chattels to one of his own serjeants. The bailiffs sent the
Town Clerk to Henry to represent that the forfeited goods of felons
rightly belonged to the town; to which the King answered that
he would not for a thousand pounds infringe in the least degree
their charters, but that the community had really no right to
these particular chattels, since the priests, being Scotch and not
the King’s subjects, could not fairly be accused of treason, and
had a perfect right to talk as they chose. On this plea he kept
the goods. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 247.)</p>

This was strictly enforced, and the town charter forfeited
if the rent fell into arrears. (Madox, 139, 161-2.) The towns
therefore made careful provision for the discharge of the debt,
sometimes setting apart a mill or some valuable property for its
payment (Madox, Firma Burgi, 251-2; Hist. MSS. Com. ix.
198-9; Nott. Rec. i. 313), or assigning certain tolls or customs;
(Shillingford’s Letters, 92); or collecting it as rent from house to
house. (Custumal in Hist. Preston Guild, 75.)</p>

When the ferm of Carlisle was raised from £60 to £80 the

Thus the Nottingham men paid 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year to Henry the
Sixth, at least from 1454, for liberties granted them. There
is no entry of this in the King’s accounts, and the only evidence
of it is in the Nottingham Records (iii. 133). The loyal
theory of Hereford was that “our goods and chattels are to be
taken and taxed at his pleasure, saving unto ourselves a competent
quantity for our sustentation and tuition of our city.”

The agreement made in the fourteenth century which fixed
the tenths and fifteenths for the towns at a permanent fixed sum,

The Admiral and his deputy had jurisdiction over everything
done on the sea and the great rivers up to the first bridge. (13
Richard II. St. 1, cap. 5; 15 Richard II., cap. 3; Blomefield,
iii. 103; Davies’ Southampton, 239-40.) In 1487 the commonalty
of Ipswich by a covenant with the King bound themselves
to take surety of every owner, master, or purser of every
English ship to twice the value of the ship, that the mariners
should keep the peace on the sea; that if the surety by any
means became less than twice the value of ship, tackle,
and victuals, new security should be taken; and that the town
should strive to arrest every robber and spoiler in the sea or the
streams thereof. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 259-60.) In 1463 a
charter was given to the corporation of York, constituting them
the King’s justiciaries for overlooking and preserving the main
rivers of Yorkshire. For the expenses and difficulties which this
involved, see Davies’ York, 59-63, 82, &amp;c.</p>

As an illustration of his difficulties, see the statute allowing
sheriffs and escheators to remain for four years in office, because
owing to pestilence and wars there was not a sufficiency of persons
to occupy these offices. (9 Henry V. St. 1, cap. 5.)</p>

In the lack of officials to carry out the regulations for the
control of trade a number of private people got royal letters
appointing them surveyors and correctors of victuallers in various
cities and boroughs, and freely used their privileges for extortion
and oppression, and the taking of heavy fines and ransoms; their
patents were gradually withdrawn; and in 1472 an Act was
passed that all such letters and patents should be void, and that
the duty of searching and surveying victuals should rest wholly
with the mayor or bailiff. (12 Edward IV. cap. 8.)</p>

In this matter the King was not allowed to interfere. In
1489 there was a dispute in Leicester between the Town Council
and the Commons about the election of a Mayor. The matter
was referred to the King, who issued a precept under the seal of
the Duchy of Lancaster, showing that it was as Lord of the
Manor and not as King that he interfered. He set aside both
candidates and reappointed the last Mayor. The next year the
question was settled by Act of Parliament. (Thomson, Mun.
Hist., 84.) For authority exercised by Parliament see Norwich
(Doc. Stanley <i>v.</i> Mayor, &amp;c. 30.) When the citizens applied
in 1378 to the King and Council for a renewal of their
ancient liberty that no stranger should have power to buy or
sell by retail, they were answered that it would not be valid
“without Parliament”; they therefore pray for a grant by
charter.</p>

the town law ran side by side may be seen in the fines for the
breach of certain rules, as, for instance, the rule against liveries,
which had to be paid both to the King and to the town.

Norwich Doc. Stanley <i>v.</i> Mayor, &amp;c. p. 3. In the great
majority of cases this grant was made once for all; but occasionally
it was renewed from time to time. Thus Henry the Sixth
in 1437 gave the mayor and burgesses of Bristol a lease of
the town and its profits for a term of twenty years. In 1446 he
granted a new lease for sixty years. In 1461 Edward the Fourth
renewed the lease, not for a term of years, but for ever. (Seyer’s
Charters of Bristol, 105.) The ferm was granted in the
same way for a term of years in the case of Dunwich, a royal
town, where it was let out to the highest bidder. Here, however,
the collection of rent was peculiarly uncertain from special circumstances
(Madox, 235-8, 241); and in 1325 Dunwich, ruined
by the filling up of its port, prayed to have the town taken into
the King’s hand and a guardian appointed. (Rot. Parl. i. 426.)
For the inconvenience of this letting out to the highest bidder,
see Madox, 251.</p>

occur in the unpublished records of Coventry. For
Romney see Lyon’s Dover, 313. In 1489 there was some such
trouble in Leicester (Thompson, Mun. Hist., 84). And in 1512
there is another instance in Nottingham (Records, iii. 341-2).
From the time of Richard the Third there seems evidence of the
growth of a new anxiety in the central government about the
democratic movement in the boroughs, and a determination to
reserve power in the hands of a small corporation. An earlier
instance may perhaps be found in the Exeter quarrel from
1477 to 1482 (English Guilds, 305, &amp;c.); and in York in 1482
(Davies, 122-4).</p>

There were many cases in which a town’s privileges were
forfeited, whether for arrears of rent (Madox, 139, 161-2) or
for other causes (154-5, 157). The franchises of Nottingham
were twice forfeited for some unknown cause&mdash;in 1283 for three
years (Records, i. 56), and in 1330 for a short time. (Ibid. 102.)
In the same year Edward the First seized the franchises of
Derby because of exactions of the Merchant Guild, but restored
them on payment of a fine. (Gross, ii. 53.) For the case of
Sandwich (Boys, 661, 676). Ipswich charter withdrawn, 1285;
regranted, 1291. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 230, 239, 243.) Chester in
1409. (Hemingway’s Chester, i. 137.) The liberties of Carlisle
were forfeited for a short time for some irregularity in the town
courts in the thirteenth century. (Gross, ii. 38.) Southampton
lost its freedom in 1276 and 1285, and again in the next
century for letting the French into the town. (Davies’ Southampton,
33, 35, 79.) Norwich suffered several times; for its
attack on the Priory in 1272; for an accusation of having
exceeded its powers in punishing crime in 1286; for riots about
the election of mayor in 1437; and for Gladman’s insurrection
in 1443. (Stanley <i>v.</i> Mayor, &amp;c., Norwich Doc., 9-12. Proceedings,
Privy Council, v. 45. Hist. MSS. Com. i. 103.) In
these cases a royal officer was appointed to rule the town; and
the complaint of Scarborough, when Edward the Second in 1324
deprived it of the right of direct payment to the Exchequer,
shows how a town suffered when its ferm was leased out. (Rot.
Parl. i. 423.) The loss of liberty was always temporary, lasting
from a few months to five or six years, and had no political
significance as in France, where it formed part of a settled policy
and had results which to the English mind seem of peculiar
importance in the history of constitutional development.</p>

Occasionally a borough was granted to a great noble or
court favourite; but more commonly as time went on the grant
merely meant giving a charge on the rent of the town. Thus
before 1339 Preston had been granted at various times to
neighbouring lords. In 1361 John of Gaunt held the manor,
but long before this the rights of the lord were so reduced that
they are practically never mentioned in the history of the town.
(Hewitson’s History of Preston, 7-8.) For the troubles to which
the nobles’ claims to rent might lead, see Davies’ Southampton,
112. Edward the Fourth granted the ferm of Bristol to the
Queen for her life. The treasurer of the King’s chamber declared
it had been assigned to him in payment of a debt and brought
an action for it against the Bristol sheriff. Bristol proved the
money had been paid to the Queen and gained the case, 1465.

In 1273 Henry de Tracy held the borough from the King in
chief at a ferm of about £5 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> There were 36 tenants
whose rent amounted to 23<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and some tenants in a suburb who
paid an uncertain rent, but generally about 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> A market was
held every Friday which yielded in tolls to the lord about £3 a
year, and a yearly fair gave 10<i>s.</i> Fines, reliefs, &amp;c., came to
about 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year. The wealth of the town increased after
the building of the “Long Bridge” in 1280 over “the great
hugy, mighty, perylous, and dreadful water named Taw,” and
the increase of the cloth trade about 1321. Towards the close
of the fourteenth century the legacies and accounts show that the
burghers were laying up considerable wealth and doing a thriving
trade. Hence probably the dispute as to the claim to profits.

The landowner of the fifteenth century was usually a mere
landlord subsisting on his rents and not interested in the produce
of the soil except as a consumer. He was only occasionally a
trader. (Rogers’ Agriculture and Prices, iv. 2; see Berkeleys, i.
365-6; ii. 23; Paston, i., lxxxviii-ix., 416, 430, 431, 454; ii.
70, 106; iii. 430; Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 263; iv. 1, 464.) The
really important classes were the new proprietors who rented
land for trading purposes.</p>

Treasures were apparently stored in different quarters for

houses had their reward in the form of benefactions for which
masses were sung for the donor. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv. i. 461.)
In the Paston house there was stored away over 16,000 ounces of
silver plate, nearly 900 yards of cloth, about 300 yards of linen,
and coats and hats without number. See also Hist. MSS. Com.

Lives of the Berkeleys, i. 130. A charter given by Baldwin of
Redvers to Plympton, 1285, grants the same rights as the citizens
of Exeter had from the King, except that Baldwin’s serfs, if
they lived in the borough, might not be granted its liberties
without his leave. (Madox, Firma Burgi, 42.) The King could
grant a number of privileges which were beyond the power of
any other lord&mdash;such as freedom from tolls throughout the
kingdom, exemption from the sheriff’s jurisdiction, freedom from
interference of royal officers, and so on; and the matter of tolls
was so important that towns on private estates were practically
obliged to get a royal charter as well as a charter from their
lord. Compare the charters given in Stubbs’ Charters, 105;
and Gross, ii, 136; with royal charters such as those in Stubbs’
Charters, 103; and Nott. Rec., i. 1. See also Hist. MSS. Com.

obtained a pardon, was released from his bond in 1462, and had

home till 1464, after he had been through a new trial and been
acquitted. (Plumpton’s Corres. lxvii-ix. 30.)</p>

For the evils of liveries and maintenance under Richard the
Second, see Richard the Redeless, Pass. i. 55 &amp;c., ii. 74 &amp;c., iii.
309 &amp;c. The wearing of liveries was forbidden in Shrewsbury
lest “when any affray or trouble fall in the said town each man
having livery would draw to his master or to his fellow and not
to the bailiffs.” (Owen, i. 217.) From the towns these evils
seem to have been rigorously and effectually banished by ordinances
from 1309 (Freeman’s Exeter, 165, 143) throughout the
two following centuries. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 557; Eng. Gilds,
385, 388-9, 393, 333; Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, page 16.) The cases

Leicester shows the comparatively slow growth of freedom
in one of the most favoured towns dependent on a great lord.
Its great charter given by Edmund Crouchback in 1277, and
translated into English under Henry the Sixth, was mainly concerned
with the ordering of legal procedure for the burghers;
and it was not till 1376 that the town bought from its earl the
right to appoint its own bailiff, and to receive the annual profits
of its courts, and various other dues and fines. The town property
was simply a tenement, a chamber, and a small place
yielding a few pence yearly till 1393, when it was allowed to hold
a little property for the repair of the bridges; and not till 1435
were the mayor and the corporation given the right to acquire
lands and rents for the sustenation of the town and mayoralty.
(Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 404, 412, 413, 414. Thompson, Mun.
Hist., 74. A pamphlet on the Origin of the Leicester Corporation
by J. D. Paul gives a translation of Crouchback’s charter.)
Doncaster belonged to the family of De Mauley till the middle of
the fifteenth century, when it passed for a few years to the Duke
of Northumberland, and in 1461 was taken into the possession of
the Crown. Edward the Fourth made it a free borough and gave
it a common seal. Henry the Seventh in 1505 granted to the
corporation all the property which the Crown had acquired at
Doncaster on the attainder of Percy in 1461, and for a yearly
rent of £74 13<i>s.</i> 11½<i>d.</i> secured to it the rights which had belonged
to the ancient feudal lords. (Hunter’s History of the Deanery
of Doncaster, i. 13-15.)</p>

In 1413 the burgesses presented a petition complaining that
their privileges were infringed upon by the shire officers coming
into the borough and holding courts by force, by which “the
said burgesses are grievously molested, vexed, and disturbed, to
the great hindrance and detriment of the said borough and the
disinheriting of the burgesses.” It was declared on the other
side, that the mayor and bailiffs had held the King’s Courts
without authority and received the tolls and profits. It is not
known how the case ended. Ibid. i. 31-2. Picton’s Mun.

The revenue from Liverpool in 1296 was £25: it then had 168
inhabited houses. (Picton’s Mem. of Liverpool, i. 20.) In 1342
the personalty of the burgesses taxed was £110 13<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, that is,
the average personalty of each was about one mark (25). The
revenue in 1327 was £30; in 1346 it was £38 (26), and
remained the same in 1394 (31). In 1444 it was reduced to
£21; in 1455 to £17 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; and under Edward the Fourth to
£14 (36-7). In 1515 an inquiry was made as to the decay of the
revenue (38), and the Act of 1544 put Liverpool in the list of
towns which had wholly fallen into decay (45). Two plagues,
one in 1540, another in 1548, probably carried off half its population
(47); and in 1565 it had but 138 inhabited houses, and
probably seven or eight hundred inhabitants, and twelve vessels
navigated on an average by six men each (55). There were
five streets under Edward the Third, and seven under Elizabeth
(62).</p>

The Bishop of Salisbury by a royal charter of 1304 got the
right to tallage the townspeople of Salisbury, while the burghers
were given municipal privileges the same as those of Winchester.
In 1305, however, the burghers, rather than pay tallage to the
bishop, surrendered their municipal privileges to the King, and
promised to give up to him their common seal. (Rot. Parl. i.
174-6.) But in the composition made the next year between the
lord bishop and the citizens, those who had shared in the revolt
and had not made their submission were utterly separated and
removed from privileges of trade or government. (Gross, ii.
209-10.) In 1396 there was again a quarrel between the bishop
and the citizens, and the case was carried to the King’s Council,
when the mayor and commonalty entered into a recognizance to
the King in £20,000 to behave well to the bishop, and two hundred
of the citizens entered into recognizances to the bishop, each one in
the sum of £1,000. In the agreement, however, certain provisions
were made to prevent the ecclesiastics from taking advantage in
any way of this treaty. (Madox, 142.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Commons in giving the grant of 1435 pray that no
prelate may be a collector, adding that the dioceses of bishops and
the neighbourhood of abbeys were greatly oppressed by ecclesiastical
lords. (Rogers’ Agric. and Prices, iv. 164.)</p>

“that I am surely concerned for your trouble, and if I could give
you ease or alleviation of your trouble I would do it most readily,
but assuredly, dear friends, I am at present in such misfortune of
money that ... wherefore I pray you, my dear friends, that
you put me in possession of my moneys as speedily as you can,
since of a truth I can no longer dispense with them which much
troubles me. And with respect to the wrong that was done to
my bailiff, you have sent me word that the parties are in agreement.
Know you that though peace be made between them the
contempt done to me is not redressed, wherefore, I pray you,

may be made to me for the aforesaid contempt. Adieu, dear

A will was proved after a proclamation by the serjeant that
on such a day it would be read in the Guild Hall before the
mayor, and anyone who wished to contradict it must then
appear. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. part 3, 153, 189.) In the earliest
wills no mention is made of probate before the ordinary; in later
registrations it is recorded that the will had received episcopal
probate before coming before the mayor. (Ibid. 155.) The cost
of this was what the people desired to avoid.</p>

In 1333 St. Alban’s brought its charter to the King’s
Chancery and renounced there all the liberties contained in the
said charter. The keeper of the rolls at their request broke off
the seal of wax, and cancelled the enrolment in the Chancery
rolls. The townsmen also brought their common seal of silver,
which at their request was destroyed and the silver given to
the shrine of St. Alban. (Madox, 140.) Common as it was in
France for a commune to renounce its freedom, there is scarcely
any instance in England save on ecclesiastical property. The case
of Dunwich was peculiar and I have met with no other.</p>

Occasionally a convent drove a hard bargain. In 1440 an
agreement was made between the convent of Plimpton and the
commonalty of Plymouth, by which the commonalty was to pay
£41 yearly, and if this rent was unpaid fifteen days after quarter
day, the officers of the convent might seize all the goods and chattels
of the mayor and commonalty and of any burgesses and of
any others residing and abiding there which could be found
within the borough and the precinct thereof. Madox, 222-3.</p>

The organization of the guild does not seem to have been at
all of a democratic or “advanced” kind, but after the pattern of
the oligarchic societies of the time. Four men owning goods to
the value of 10 marks were elected yearly, by a committee of
twelve burgesses, to hold the guild, and summoned to do their
duty by two officers of the guild called “les Dyes.”</p>

Some of the fines levied were doubtless used for the townsmen’s
benefit. For example, there were nineteen bridges within the
limits of the borough, which after the dissolution of the monastery
fell into decay and were repaired in the time of Elizabeth with
the stones from the abbey walls. (Coates’s Reading, 64.) But
material advantages did not take the place of political freedom.</p>

Gross, i., 90-1. The number of burghers in the Guild seems
to have been very small. In 1486, 28 burghers paid <i>chepin
gavell</i>; in 1487, 22 burgesses; and in 1490-93, 31 burgesses.
In 1510 there were 45 burgesses. (Coates’s Reading, 58.)
There were many who paid fines and dues to the abbot who were
of the town and not of the Guild, and this class was doubtless
encouraged by the convent, following the same policy as the bishop
in Lynn. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. part 7, 172, 175-6.)</p>

The Guilds were naturally looked on with very little favour
by the ecclesiastical lords in such cases. There was a conflict
between abbot and town at Malmesbury in the time of Edward
the First. The burghers claimed to have a Guild of their own
people, who alone had a right to trade in the town, and to take
certain taxes for the support of the Guild from all traders who
were not of it. The abbot refused to allow them to use their
rights. The town fell back on its liberties <i>when it had been a
royal borough</i>, and appealed to the King. (Gross, ii. 173.) See
also the precautions taken by the Bishop about the Guild at
Salisbury. (Ibid. 209-10.)</p>

made easier for the townspeople by constant talk of loans to the

For the bishop’s rights during the fair such as tronage,
authority to take all weights and measures and bear them to the
Pavilion and there make assay, to demand that the people of
the city should come to the Pavilion to present cry raised and bloodshed,
and other things touching the peace of our Lord the King,
see Hist. MSS. Com. vi. 595-605. Compare his powers in
Southampton during the same fair. There he might send his
bailiff to see that only food was weighed or sold in the town,
that no merchant whether resident or not ventured to sell
anything except food, that there was no weighing or measuring,
that merchants who came with their goods swore they did
not bring them to sell at this time. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi.
part 3, pp. 67, 68.) The convent also had its own home and
foreign trade on a very large scale. (Kitchin’s Winchester, 161.)</p>

In 1244 a mayor who had obeyed the King’s orders to shut
the city gates against a bishop whose election the King opposed,
was severely punished by the bishop when he gained possession
of his see and palace. (Kitchin’s Winchester, 121.) The mayor
was thrown into a London prison because a state prisoner had
escaped from Winchester. (Ibid. 139.)</p>

His temper towards ecclesiastical interference and his
urbanity in argument are admirably shown in a letter to the
bishop’s counsel. The rough draft of the letter ends with a fine
outburst of anger. “We would fain have an end,” he writes,
and goes on to ask how it was possible for any one ever to
conceive that “John Shillyng, for no dread of great words of
malice, disclaunders, language, writings, nor setting up of bulls
to that intent to rebuke me and to make me dull to labour for the
right that I am sworn to, for truly I will not be so rebuked nor
dulled, but the more boldlier.” But he struck out this vigorous
passage in the second draft in favour of a less belligerent sentence&mdash;”for
ye may fully conceive that my fellows and I would fain
have a good end and peace, praying you to apply your good will
and favour to the same.” Shillingford’s Letters, 25.</p>

Shillingford’s Letters, 83, 84, 99. Compare Norwich,
Blomefield, iii. 62. In Canterbury the murder of a citizen by a
waggoner of the priory in 1313 gave rise to a hot dispute as to
the jurisdiction of the city coroner. The Convent refused him
admittance within the priory gates, smuggled in an alien coroner to
view the body, and then had it buried by the prior’s grooms. The
story is given in an Inspeximus of Richard the Second; Muniments
of Canterbury.</p>

The distribution of taxes was a matter of special arrangement
in the different towns. By the request of the canons the
ecclesiastical tenants at Grimsby were not tallaged with the
burgesses (Madox, 270). In Leicester the tenants of the Bishop’s
Fee just without the walls did suit and service to the Bishop of
Lincoln; a compromise had been made in 1281 by which it
was decided that the Bishop’s tenants should share in certain common
expenses, and should in return enjoy the franchises and free
customs which had been won by the Merchant Guild of Leicester;
but while the burgesses had to bear the charges both of “the
community of the town,” and “the community of the guild,” the
bishop’s tenants only paid for such matters as touched “the community
of the guild,” and were not liable for the general town
taxes. (Gross, ii. 140-1.) As early as 1189 the Guild of
Nottingham obtained the right to raise contributions to the ferm
rent from tenants of all fees whatsoever. In Norwich this was
given in 1229 (Norwich Doc., Stanley <i>v.</i> Mayor, etc., 5, 6). But
the question of collection still remained a burning one, and the
itinerant justices having failed in 1239 to settle matters between
the convent and the city, the King himself went to Norwich to
insist on an agreement in 1241. (Blomefield, iii. 46.) See
p. 357, note 4.</p>

The tenants of the hospital of S. John in Worcester refused
to aid in tallages, to submit to the assize of bread and beer, under
the town’s officers, and to keep watch and ward. In 1221 they
were ordered to do all these things. (Select Pleas of the Crown,
Selden Soc. p. 97.) In 1331 Norwich resisted the handing
over of three houses to the prior and convent “for that a very
great part of the same city which is inhabited, is in the hands of
the prior and convent and of other religious persons, whereby the
inhabitants are at their distress, and cannot be tallaged to the
tallages and aids of the lord the King and of the city aforesaid
as tenants should be, nor can they be in assizes, juries, and recognizances,
whereby others dwelling in the same city are burdened

In Canterbury also the Convent was bent on getting possession
of that part of the covered way which lay along its territory,
and the city wall itself so far as it touched the Cathedral
precincts. Their first step was taken in 1160, and their final
success was not assured till 1492, when the city resigned to the
Convent the wall and covered way between Burgate and Northgate
with the waste land adjoining, and the chapter was allowed
to make a postern and to build a bridge across the foss. Such an
arrangement was of course only possible at a time when peace
with France, and the close of civil wars and riots at home had
freed the town from danger of siege or revolution. (Lit. Cant.,
i. 60-2, iii. 318-20.) See also Davies’ Walks through York,

claret and wines white and red, and the beer and ale,

five capons, two geese, a side of brawn, two lambs, four rabbits,
beef, marrow bones, a jowl of salmon, gurnards, roach, bread,
spices, salt, vinegar, butter, milk, eggs, lard, and suet. Sacks of
coal were always bought for the cooking of these great dinners,
either charcoal sold in sacks, or “sea-cole” sold by the tub.

Ibid. ix. 146-7. The chamberlain’s accounts give
the costs of one visit to London of mayor and aldermen
on business of the town. Three counsel were paid 10<i>s.</i>;
one of them “in the cloister at Paul’s when he corrected
the copy,” got 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and his clerk 12<i>d.</i> The mayor gathered
together all the witnesses in a house beside Paul’s to rehearse
their evidence “against they came into the Star Chamber,”
and paid for bread and drink and house room for them 16<i>d.</i>
At Westminster Hall the three counsel got 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> each, and
for the three days following the same fees were daily paid.
In the Star Chamber Master Roydon paid for examination of
sixteen persons at 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a man, 37<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; two days after fees
were again paid to two counsel, and a breakfast given to Sir
Matthew Browne. Master Fisher was paid for the fees of the
Hilary term 19<i>s.</i> Warrants of attorney cost 4<i>s.</i>, and copies of
the panels 2<i>s.</i> The counsel had to be looked up in their country
houses, and messengers were always crossing Tilbury Ferry to
look for “Master Raimond,” and give him a retaining fee “to be
our counsel,” or going to Finchley to seek “Master Frowick,”
perhaps to find that “he was then ridden to Walsingham, so the
said Thomas came to London homeward again.” The Master
Recorder of London was met coming to the Temple and besought
“to be good master to the city,” and retained at a cost of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
with a breakfast to his servants in Fleet Street. Then a messenger
waited at the Guild Hall for the recorder, and again
watched for him “the same day at afternoon at Milord Dawbeny’s
place, there waiting till the said Master Recorder had supped,
and when he came out we besought him to speed us, for the time
of the forfeit passed not three days; which answered that he was
sore occupied and might not entende it so shortly, where we took
him 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, and then he bade us wait on him on the morrow in
the Temple. The next day when Mr. Recorder had contrived
the bill and corrected it, for his reward 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Paid for a pike
given to Master Mordaunt 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” The mayor then sent to
Canterbury to direct that some gift should be sent up which
might be used in “making friends”; and several members of
the Common Council travelled up with two trouts (one trout cost
about 10<i>s.</i>) and ten capons. The witnesses examined in the Star
Chamber each got 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and their travelling expenses; after
their examination they adjourned to the buttery for an entertainment,
and paid “in reward to the officers of the King’s buttery
for their good cheer 12<i>d.</i> and to the cook of the King’s kitchen
8<i>d.</i>” Besides all this there was a great deal of feasting and
drinking in eight of the London inns, in Southwark, Cheap,
Fleet Street, Paul’s Chain, and Holborn. Hist. MSS. Com. ix.

wanteth that same general vein of a republic which runneth in

I dare not advise to adventure this great trade of the kingdom,

Dover had always remained in the King’s hands, but Hythe
and Romney belonged to the Archbishop, while Sandwich had
been given to Christ Church, Canterbury, and Hastings, Winchelsea,
and Rye had been handed over to the Abbey of Fécamp.
A few details about the relations of Fécamp to its possessions at
Hastings, Winchelsea, and Rye, may be found in Leroux de
Lincy’s Abbaye de Fécamp, pp. 289, 294, 300, 327, 331; and
a notice of the tax called <i>aletot</i> which was paid by the inhabitants
of Rye to Fécamp, p. 299. The two parish churches of
Hastings, being part of the alien priory of Fécamp, were never
appropriate or belonging either to the College of S. Mary or
to the Priory. They were afterwards granted away by Henry
the Eighth (Horsfield’s Hastings, i. 448). The Counts of Eu
held the Castle with the whole of the rape of Hastings and
the manor till their estates were forfeited by rebellion about
1245 and given by Henry the Third to his son Edward. Moss’

Ports joined Simon de Montfort against the King. Possibly this
revolt was due to the limits fixed to their territory by Henry in

In 1395 Romney contributed nearly £10 to the maintenance
of the liberties of the Cinque Ports, and in 1407, 1408, and 1409,
it had to spend over £5 each year in payment for such purposes.
The renewal of these charters on one occasion cost
Hythe £17 as its share. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 535, 537.) These
payments were over and above the sums which had to be given
for the charters of each separate Port, and which were also a
heavy cost.</p>

These four bailiffs aided by a provost chosen by the Yarmouth
commonalty, took over the keys of the prison, issued all

dispensed with. (Lyon’s Dover i. xii.)</p>

It was already well established in the fourteenth century,
and possibly much earlier, that orders of the Court of Shepway
as to the taxes required for the King or for the general purposes
of the Ports became the basis of agreements made between the
Ports at the Brodhull concerning the share of taxes to be paid by
each Port. See Burrows’ Cinque Ports, 180-1.</p>

In 1412 a curious agreement between the mariners of France
and England was signed by Romney and Lydd, and probably by
all the ports from Southampton to Thanet. It provided that if
any master or mariner were captured the only ransom to be
asked on either side should be six nobles for the master and
three for the mariner with 20 pence a week board for each; a
fishing boat with nets and tackles was to be set free for 40 pence;
any man taken on either coast should be charged no ransom, but
a gentleman or merchant who was taken might be charged any
ransom that his captor chose. In case of any dispute, arbitrators
were appointed; if these were disobeyed 100<i>s.</i> was to be paid on
one side to S. Nicholas at Romney, on the other side to the
Church of Hope All Saints. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 537-538.)
The arrangement as to the place of payment of the fine was
doubtless different in each town of the league. The common
serjeant of Hythe in the same year rode to Dover to get
a copy of the composition for his own town. In a disputed
case when the plaintiff and defendant seem to have been of
Romney, questions touching the “Law of Oleron,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Law
Maritime, were decided “by the judgment of the masters of ships
and boats of the vills of Hastings, Winchelsea, Sandwich, and
Dover,” that is, a majority of the seven towns. (Hist. MSS. Com.
vi. 543.)</p>

At any time the court might be summoned to redress a
wrong, and not only the jurats and commonalty of a town but

Burrows (Cinque Ports, 238) suggests that Lydd, like the
supposed case of Faversham, might have owed its incorporation
under a mayor and jurats to the Court of Shepway. He does
not give any reasons for this supposition. Lydd was under the
Archbishop; Faversham under the abbot until the suppression
of the abbey. Ibid. 234.</p>

In 1412 Hythe sent two of its citizens to London to see
the Archbishop and the Lord Chancellor and succeeded in winning
some relief from the ancient customary services to the King.
In the fifteenth century the Archbishop sometimes appointed the

the town for a term of years. Cranmer leased it out for ninety-nine
years. It only got a mayor under Elizabeth. (Burrows’

Rye there is an entry of 19<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for the expenses of the mayor,
bailiff, common clerk and four jurats at Dover, “going and returning
on carrying the men’s quarters, when the mayor and bailiff
with four jurats were sent under the heaviest penalty, and on pain
of contempt of our lord the King.” Another two pence was spent
in giving them a drink of malmsey before dinner (Hist. MSS
Com. v. 492, 493); and the same year “the men of the Lord
Warwick entered the town with a strong band and took down the
quarter of the man and buried it in the churchyard.” In 1470
Romney and the other Cinque Ports supported Warwick against
Edward, 1469-70. (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 545.) For Lydd, p. 525;

the Sixth from October 1470 to April 1471, an entry in Lydd
records “on the second Sunday after the feast of St. Michael the
Archangel in the  year of King Henry the Sixth.” (Hist.

it. For the sufferings of Kent in the war see Warkworth’s

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
